<blockquote class="calibre_12"><span class="calibre5">Diverging paths</span></blockquote><p class="calibre_13"><span class="calibre7">A </span>s Jake was relaxing, he reflected on how weird stamina was. He was not tired per se, as he did not feel like taking a nap, and his muscles did not ache or anything like that. He had not felt even a second of exhaustion during the fight itself, and yet the second the battle was done, he’d felt drained.</p><p class="calibre_14">It was likely just mental exhaustion over physical exhaustion, now that he was thinking about it. There was no stat for that. <span class="italic">Or does Willpower help with that? </span>Naturally, he didn’t know, so he could only guess, but since he hadn't really felt less mentally taxed even with the stat increases, he felt like it didn’t.</p><p class="calibre_14">It did kind of make sense that it was tiring to focus on interpreting the feelings from his Sphere of Perception all the time while also being under constant pressure. At the moment, it was still active, vaguely making him aware of everything within eight meters or so, but he was not really directly using it. He couldn’t really put it into words, but he guessed one would say it had an “active” and a “passive” mode.</p><p class="calibre_14">Not that he had any clue how it worked. He just knew what was within it. He did not expressly “see” anything; he just knew the shapes and sizes of everything. It would take a lot of experimentation to truly figure out if it was even possible ever to do so, and for some reason, Jake doubted he would get any answers from just sitting there. Instead, he decided to go through his system notifications and level-ups. And boy, were there notifications.</p><p class="calibre_15"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">*You have slain [Human (G) - lvl 3 / Warrior (Light) - lvl 6] – Bonus experience earned for killing an enemy above your level. 365 TP earned*</span></span></p><p class="calibre_15"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">*You have slain [Human (G) - lvl 2 / Archer - lvl 5] – Experience earned. 243 TP earned*</span></span></p><p class="calibre_15"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">*You have slain [Human (G) - lvl 3 / Warrior (Light) - lvl 7] – Bonus experience earned for killing an enemy above your level. 471 TP earned*</span></span></p><p class="calibre_15"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">*’DING!’ Class: [Archer] has reached level 6 - Stat points allocated, +1 Free Point*</span></span></p><p class="calibre_15"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">*’DING!’ Race: [Human (G)] has reached level 3 - Stat points allocated, +1 Free Point*</span></span></p><p class="calibre_15"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">*You have slain [Human (G) - lvl 3 / Warrior (Light) - lvl 6] – Experience earned. 394 TP earned*</span></span></p><p class="calibre_15"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">*You have slain [Human (G) - lvl 3 / Archer - lvl 7] – A small amount of bonus experience earned for killing an enemy with a class above your class level. 654 TP earned*</span></span></p><p class="calibre_15"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">*You have slain [Human (G) - lvl 4 / Archer - lvl 9] – Bonus experience earned for killing an enemy above your level. 1167 TP earned*</span></span></p><p class="calibre_15"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">*’DING!’ Class: [Archer] has reached level 7 - Stat points allocated, +1 Free Point*</span></span></p><p class="calibre_17">The gains were good, and he was especially surprised to see that Nicholas had been level 9 with quite a lot of tutorial points too, indicating that he had indeed killed a lot of beasts. He was strong, after all. It made Jake wonder if Richard had lied when he said that he was level 9, but it was honestly inconsequential for now.</p><p class="calibre_14">He only had a single Free Point left from the last level-up, as midway through the fight, he’d thrown all his points into Perception. Perception was, without a doubt, the stat that he liked the most, and he felt like it had great synergy with his Bloodline ability. Based on that, he decided just to drop his one Free Point into Perception as he opened his newly upgraded status menu.</p><blockquote class="calibre_18"><span class="bold">Status</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_19">Name: Jake Thayne</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_19">Race: [Human (G) – lvl 3]</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_19">Class: [Archer – lvl 7]</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_19">Profession: N/A</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_19">Health Points (HP): 257/340</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_19">Mana Points (MP): 88/140</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_19">Stamina: 151/210</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_19"><span class="bold">Stats</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_19">Strength: 21</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_19">Agility: 22</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_19">Endurance: 21</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_19">Vitality: 34</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_19">Toughness: 13</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_19">Wisdom: 14</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_19">Intelligence: 14</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_19">Perception: 37</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_19">Willpower: 12</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_19">Free Points: 0</blockquote><p class="calibre_17">Once more, he confirmed the weirdness of the Endurance stat. Due to the level-ups, his maximum stamina had increased by 40, making his current also increase by 40. Which ultimately led to him having more stamina than when he’d begun the fight. He also decided to check the tutorial panel now that he was fiddling with menus.</p><p class="calibre_15"><span class="bold">Tutorial Panel</span></p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="bold">Duration: 63 days &amp; 2:27:39</span></p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="bold">Total Survivors Remaining: 987/1200</span></p><p class="calibre_1"><span class="bold">TP Collected: 4629</span></p><p class="calibre_17"><span class="italic">So many people have died, and not even the first day has passed</span>, he thought. Two hundred and thirteen people dead, more than one-sixth of the total amount of those who had entered the tutorial. Not that Jake had helped that statistic in any way, being personally responsible for nine of those deaths.</p><p class="calibre_14">He had no clue if his TP was a lot or a little, but according to the rules, he got half the TP of people he killed, so he assumed it had to be a lot. If Nicholas had given him 1167, he would have had double that at 2334, which was still only a bit over half of what he currently had. Not that he had any idea what those damn points could be used for quite yet.</p><p class="calibre_14">His amount of points was rather respectable, though, as Nicholas had been level 9, while Jake was only level 7. But it did kind of make sense, as he took the accumulated points of people who had killed plenty of enemies to get to their levels. He also had no clue exactly how much TP different enemies gave. He had gotten over 300 from the level 10 boar, and that had been a shared kill.</p><p class="calibre_14">For the badgers, he’d gotten 4 points from the level 3 ones, and 8 from the level 4 one. The sample size was way too small, but maybe the points just doubled for every level? Though that seemed insane. It did kind of fit with a level 10 boar giving a total of 512, and him getting 300 plus of that on a shared kill.</p><p class="calibre_14">But that would mean a level 11 beast would give 1024, a level 12 2048, then 4096, and so on. It just seemed way too extreme to work like that. A level 20 beast would give a whopping 524,288 points, which was just absolutely insane if true. Granted, he had no idea how strong a level 20 beast would be, but he doubted they would warrant such a huge point increase.</p><p class="calibre_14">Once more, he shook his head at his useless internal thoughts. It was a waste of time to think about, and he would just have to go hunt beasts to find out how many points each level gave easily.</p><p class="calibre_14">He closed all his menus and got up feeling refreshed in both mind and body despite only relaxing for ten minutes. He walked over to Nicholas’ body. Jake could still see the unwillingness on his face, but nothing could be done about that. They had fought, and Jake had come out on top.</p><p class="calibre_14">He had already resolved himself to give a respectable sendoff to the man, but had quickly met the obstacle of not having anything to dig with. He refused to leave the man’s body for a bunch of overgrown badgers or deer to eat, so just leaving the body out in the open was not an option. Logically, it was a waste of time, but one could not always remain logical.</p><p class="calibre_14">He instead decided to make a small fire. Fire was rather easy to make by creating sparks with two daggers, one of which he had taken from one of the dead archers. It was in no way a glorious pyre, but it got the job done. He watched solemnly as the corpse burned, nodding toward what had once been a powerful enemy as the flames consumed it.</p><p class="calibre_14">Despite being in the same place for a couple of hours while preparing and burning the body, no one showed up. Jake guessed that Richard had decided not to send any more would-be assassins after him for now.</p><p class="calibre_14">With him being done there, he went to a nearby river and washed himself and his cloak. He bathed in full clothes, his dress shirt and pants still on. The only thing he took off was his shoes and socks, as getting them wet somehow seemed too much.</p><p class="calibre_14">After cleaning himself and returning his cloak to more brown than red, he decided to set out once more and finally get his solo hunting underway. Excited to get started, he smiled and ran into the depths of the forest once more, like a child entering an amusement park.</p><p class="calibre_15"><img src="images/00010.jpg" class="calibre_21"/>    </p><p class="calibre_16">Richard had sent off Nicholas and the other fighters with the stealth skill nearly an hour ago. They knew to return to their original camp once the job was done, and he had nearly expected to meet them there. It took a good forty minutes to walk with the newbies to their camp, arriving with little hassle along the way.</p><p class="calibre_14">The situation was kind of awkward as they walked, but Richard had talked to the young man named Jacob and found him to be rather competent. He was good at reading people, and his group of survivors clearly listened to him and respected him. He was protective of them, but Richard only saw that as a bonus. Despite only interacting with the young man for a bit over half an hour, he had already come to have a modicum of respect for him.</p><p class="calibre_14">The only thing he was annoyed at was the lack of information he got on the archer he had sent Nicholas after.</p><p class="calibre_14">Jacob claimed that he had been their coworker before the initiation, and that was about it. He seemed to barely know the guy. The only thing he knew was that he was good with a bow and that he tended to like being alone. It was annoying, but ultimately, it mattered little, as the archer was likely already dead by the time the point was discussed.</p><p class="calibre_14">Or at least he assumed he was. But the lack of the kill squad who’d gone after him made him worried. The young man had been self-confident to the level of being ridiculous, and Richard was starting to fear that it had not all been bravado. Most of it had been, without a doubt, as he was pretty sure he remembered one of his lines being from a movie, but the paranoia still crept up on him.</p><p class="calibre_14">Losing a member or two would be more than annoying. They had poured quite a few resources into them after all, raising them all to at least level 5. He had not for a second considered them being wiped out.</p><p class="calibre_14">Nicholas was too good for that, in his opinion. He was at the same level as himself, and Richard had no confidence in fighting the man head-on. He’d been strong before the tutorial, and in here, he was only stronger. He did have a small fear that Nicholas would one day turn on him, but it did not seem too probable so far. Either way, he saw no scenario in which that arrogant bastard of an archer survived.</p><p class="calibre_14">Arriving at their small camp with the newbies, the new arrivals looked about, with Richard nodding at the progress in his absence. The camp was basic, to say the least, but they had started constructing some makeshift huts using sticks and leaves, with some grander buildings already being planned. If they had to spend over two months here, they would have to make safe shelter eventually, and no time was better than the present.</p><p class="calibre_14">After waiting another quarter of an hour, he saw someone running toward the camp, and he didn’t immediately recognize him. A haggard teenager with cuts and bruises all over stumbled out the trees, making him get a better look. At first, Richard was happy, as he recognized him as one of Nicholas’ men, but soon frowned as he noticed him being alone.</p><p class="calibre_14">Getting a closer look, he saw the pure terror still present on the face of the youth. Richard instantly turned serious as several questions quickly popped up in his head. Could they have met a dangerous beast out there? Another group? Where was Nicholas?</p><p class="calibre_14">He took a brisk walk toward the kid and practically collided with him. Before the kid could open his mouth, Richard cut him off:</p><p class="calibre_14">"What happened? Where is Nicholas? Where the hell is the rest of your squad?"</p><p class="calibre_14">"D… dead," the kid barely managed to stammer out.</p><p class="calibre_14">Richard momentarily froze. "Did Nicholas kill them?" he asked. If Nicholas had betrayed him…</p><p class="calibre_14">"He… died…"</p><p class="calibre_14">"WHAT!?" Richard screamed, clearly scaring the already-terrified kid. The kid barely managed to explain in bits and pieces how they had gotten into a fight and killed off, but Richard interrupted him. "If he killed everyone," Richard yelled, taking a deep breath as he looked down on the kid, "then why the fuck are you alive?"</p><p class="calibre_14">At this point, the other people in the camp had noticed the commotion, including Jacob, who Richard noticed got closer to listen in. He knew that Jacob was aware he had sent people after Jake and had hoped that his friend could somehow get away. It was an open secret that no one talked about.</p><p class="calibre_14">Richard did notice the man honestly looked unsure whether he should be happy or not that his friend had killed a bunch of people. This did at least confirm to Richard that Jacob had not been lying about his lack of comprehension of that archer’s skills.</p><p class="calibre_14">The young archer before him, on the other hand, was nearly pissing himself at this point. He gritted his teeth and explained what had happened in more detail. How they had been ambushed, and two people had died as all they could do was try and get to cover. He told everything he knew, leaving out only the fact that he had hidden cowardly for the entire thing.</p><p class="calibre_14">"He left me alive because he wanted me to deliver a message," the archer said. "He told me that Nicholas fought well… and that he was serious about what he said earlier."</p><p class="calibre_14">The teenager looked like he left out something because he was scared, perhaps afraid Richard would get more furious with him. It didn’t help as Richard was still fuming nonetheless. He was red in his face but, at the same time, very hesitant about what exactly to do. He looked at the kid, who, in turn, looked like he was contemplating if he should say something.</p><p class="calibre_14">"What else? Spit it out!" he said, staring angrily.</p><p class="calibre_14">"Boss… he was not normal. He… he enjoyed it… Smiled while covered in blood… A monster."</p><p class="calibre_14">Richard was taken aback. He would normally yell more at the kid, but what he saw before him was not just a scared kid, but someone utterly terrified. Reprimanding him would do no good. He instead turned to Jacob, who stood not far away.</p><p class="calibre_14">Jacob also looked shocked at what he heard, especially the last part. Well, it made sense to get surprised if you heard your friend described as a monster. Yet the man looked like he still had some understanding of why the kid would assume it.</p><p class="calibre_14">"What the hell is up with that guy?" Richard finally asked as he looked over at Jacob.</p><p class="calibre_14">Jacob seemed to finally have decided to stand his ground. He had heard what the kid said. He knew his friend was out there, and he was a genuine threat from the sound of it. He was his group's strongest bargaining chip along with Caroline. And while Richard didn’t have a high opinion of Jacob, he did strike him as a good businessman, one who knew he had just gained another card in his hand.</p><p class="calibre_14">"He is my friend and coworker, like I told you, and he is particularly good with a bow. And when it comes to fighting, or ‘hunting’ as he calls it, he gets a bit in the zone per se. He is weird, he is a loner. I quite honestly don’t understand much about him, but the one thing I do know is that he’s my friend."</p><p class="calibre_14">Richard looked at Jacob and saw no indication of the man lying about anything.</p><p class="calibre_14"><span class="italic">Whatever he is, Richard thought, he isn’t worth it.</span></p><p class="calibre_14">He had lost enough good men for one day.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_32"></div>
