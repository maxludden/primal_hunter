Welcome to Darkworld, a savage survival game where Brad and his sassy Chihuahua, Slash, think they’ve got it all figured out. Brad’s a strategy gamer, after all. Build a shelter, grow crops, forge weapons, and form alliances to escape this nightmare. Do that and they’ll find their way out of the game in one piece. But Darkworld’s creators have a twisted purpose. Game guides are less reliable than a rusty sword. An AI is hell-bent on breaking players. There are trolls, goblins, vampires, and worse, off-key bards. Even if Brad gets past them, he has the butchers to contend with. Sadistic people who paid to carve up players like Thanksgiving turkeys. Brad can’t fail. Dying in the game doesn’t just mean GAME OVER. Fail, and it’s like being flushed down the metaverse’s toilet. Poof! Vanished like a glitchy NPC. What’s worse than being dead? Being erased like you never existed at all. The rules are brutal. The stakes are high. Success is nearly impossible. Victory means more than loot and leveling up. <span class="class_s6gb">Time to engage full-on warrior mode and unleash your inner hero to become the ultimate survivor in this action-packed LitRPG series perfect for fans of </span><span class="class_s6h2">Dungeon Crawler Carl </span><span class="class_s6gb">and</span><span class="class_s6h2"> This Trilogy is Broken! </span><span class="class_s6gb">When you start a game with nothing but a loincloth, a dog who cusses like a sailor, and only your wits, there’s one way to go.</span></p></div>

Instead, Drake got abducted, tossed into a fantasy world, and almost ritually executed by a pro-wrestler monk with performance issues. After stabbing his rather idiotic kidnapper to death, he magically inherits the old fart’s massive mansion, servants, mountains of gold, and deadly magic powers... which would be great if it also didn’t paint a giant target on his back. Now that he’s the Lord of Gloomwood Manor, enemies across the world want to claim Drake's life and title. Before that happens, he must learn to use his powerful magic, win his people’s loyalty, and fake being powerful until he actually becomes so powerful no one dares challenge him. <span class="class_s6gb">The first volume of a humorous adventure fantasy featuring cat girls, battle maids, political machinations, and a habit of setting the worst isekai tropes on fire and tossing them in the garbage.</span></p></div>
