      <p class="first first-in-chapter first-full-width first-with-first-letter-w"><span class="first-letter first-letter-w first-letter-without-punctuation">W</span>hy the hell would he leave a dungeon when he had spent so much time gathering those goddamn mushrooms? He had yet to use more than a handful of them, and he still had more than a dozen of the Infused variant.</p>
      <p class="subsq">When Jake chose to remain in the dungeon, the entire door lit up with runes springing to life. He felt some energy enter his body, and he tried to remove his hand but failed. It was like a pulse went through his entire being before entering the door again.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Finally, he could let go. He retracted his hand as the door began opening.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Jake was shocked at what had happened… It felt like the damn door had scanned him or something. Whatever it had done, it appeared wholly unrelated to the Deepdwellers. He looked through the opening of the gate and saw it led into a new chamber. He also saw it in his sphere, but so far, nothing was visible in that either, so Jake decided to just venture further in.</p>
      <p class="subsq">His danger sense was still entirely silent. He frowned, as he was confused about what the hell all of this was leading towards.</p>
      <p class="subsq">When he exited the tunnel and reached the other side of the hall, he found himself in an absolutely massive chamber. Before he had even fought the Heartwarden, he had noticed how there were vines in the chamber and that they were all gathering towards one point… and he finally saw what that point was.</p>
      <p class="subsq">In the center of the chamber was what looked like an inert metal sphere with several metal rings around it, all held up by vines that had grown around it. The metal itself was completely unscathed, even if it did look like the vines had tried to break through the exterior of the sphere.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Jake could instantly see why… The inside of that sphere was completely solid. Not with metal, but pure fucking energy. He could only see inside with his sphere, and even his Sense of the Malefic Viper didn’t react at all, meaning the sphere completely isolated whatever energy was within.</p>
      <p class="subsq">He inspected the rest of the chamber, and he spotted quite a few things, the first of which was a wooden door in a small cave off to the side of the chamber, not leading to anywhere. It didn’t take a genius to know it was an exit to the dungeon, and Jake stepped over to investigate. Putting his hand on it, he confirmed it was indeed a way to exit.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Did that mean if he left and re-entered, he would be put back in this chamber? If nothing else, that would confirm dungeons could have different &quot;checkpoints&quot; of sorts. Then again, maybe it truly was just an exit like so many other dungeons, as this chamber would be the last thing to explore.</p>
      <p class="subsq">He at least hadn’t seen any exits or entrances to the chamber other than the gate he had entered through.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Another thing he noticed in his sphere was a slew of stone slabs with magic circles on them like those outside. All of them were covered in vines, making Jake believe the Deepdwellers had cleared the ones outside.</p>
      <p class="subsq"><i>I guess this is what the mushrooms are for</i>, he thought as he began clearing out the vines. He summoned his bow and fired a few exploding arcane arrows to make all the slabs visible. He could have gone and placed the mushrooms then and there to see what would happen, but instead, he chugged a potion, sat down on his ass, and meditated.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Why would he face whatever was about to come on low resources? The Heartwarden hadn’t been that dangerous, but it had still taken plenty of resources. Hence, he meditated.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Eventually Jake got up, fully refueled and ready to face whatever was to come! He was a few potion bottles poorer, but in excellent health and in good spirits as he began going around the chamber, placing mushrooms.</p>
      <p class="subsq">He hummed as he did so, excited to see what would happen. As the magic circles lit up, Jake began to see a pattern. All of them had a single line leading into the middle of the chamber, directly below the metal sphere floating above.</p>
      <p class="subsq">It turned out that there was exactly one mushroom for every circle in the dungeon. The last two were sadly not Infused, but Jake still hoped it would be good enough for whatever was to come.</p>
      <p class="subsq">As he placed the last mushroom… everything hummed to life.</p>
      <p class="subsq">A beam of energy fired up from all the magic circles—especially the area right below the sphere—with their destination being the sphere itself. It greedily absorbed the energy until all the magic circles ran out of power and became inert once more, leaving the mushrooms as ash.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Everything was just silent for a moment, and Jake feared that the last two mushrooms not being infused had made everything fail. He was about to admonish himself when he heard a sound above. It sounded almost like a dynamo starting…</p>
      <p class="subsq">Because it was.</p>
      <p class="subsq">The rings of metal above the sphere began spinning to life, breaking the vines holding onto them. The rings spun faster and faster until not even Jake could keep up with how fast they went. Somehow they didn’t send out any wind. Even if it were just looked at like a fan, the sheer speed would have ripped the entire hall apart, Jake included.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Jake just stood there, confused about what the fuck was happening, his entire body tense. The amount of energy that dynamo was giving off was <i>not </i>something that should be in a goddamn D-grade dungeon. The amount of energy was way above that… perhaps even above C-grade. A part of him considered bailing, but his instincts had yet to warn him, making him believe that this dynamo was not any danger to him.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Finally, something happened.</p>
      <p class="subsq">The sphere hanging above projected a mid-air blue screen with text Jake could actually read.</p>

      <p class="subsq">Before he could react, the dynamo shot out one of its rings, which landed right below the floating sphere. It formed a magic circle in less than a fraction of a second, once more showing a level of power that did not belong in a D-grade dungeon. The teleportation circle to the assessment, Jake assumed.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Jake didn’t move immediately but frowned instead, as he’d just had a lot thrown at him at once.</p>
      <p class="subsq">First of all, the screen before him <i>hadn’t</i> been made by the system—that was for sure. It had been made by the Altmar Empire, as far as Jake could tell. It had a lot of weird text in it, like assuring him it was still a part of the dungeon and how doing this assessment of theirs would count towards system rewards. What was all this grouping nonsense? This was the first time Jake had seen a dungeon that had Challenge Dungeon-like mechanics within. Well, he hadn’t done that many before, but it still seemed out of place.</p>
      <p class="subsq">The whole thing about his assessment made him frown even more. How did they know his level? Had the door scanned him? Had they somehow bypassed Shroud of the Primordial to read it?</p>
      <p class="subsq">Shit, he had so many damn questions.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Wasn’t the Altmar Empire some big elven faction? How the hell were they in a dungeon? Moreover, why the hell did this thing recognize that? Was this dungeon not a natural one like Villy had said it would be? Who else could have made it…? How the hell had an elven empire managed to make a dungeon in a new universe? Jake hated to ask so often, but he had to know.</p>
      <p class="subsq"><i>&quot;What an interesting coincidence</i>,” Villy said. “<i>Those elves are always up to something, I tell ya. Just do it normally; you are still in a natural dungeon. Act like all of it is the flavor text for now, and just do your best.&quot;</i> He promptly cut the connection right after delivering this information, clearly amused on his end by Jake’s confusion.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Villy didn’t help Jake much… but thinking about it, didn’t he also have a cauldron offered by the Altmar Empire? Were they just suppliers of cauldrons and dungeons to the system or what? He couldn’t figure out what the fuck was happening, so he did the most natural thing to him.</p>
      <p class="subsq">He completely ignored it and went straight for the teleportation circle.</p>

      <p class="first first-in-section first-full-width">Several kilometers above the dynamo within the Deepdweller Undergrowth, a chamber suddenly lit up. Screens lining the walls began showing images of the chamber below, and many different devices came to life. It happened as the dynamo also hummed to life, and power was restored.</p>
      <p class="subsq">In the center of it all, a hologram-like projection appeared. It was that of a humanoid elven figure. It instantly made a motion, and a small device lowered itself from the ceiling to begin recording everything happening in the room and on the screens.</p>
      <p class="subsq">For a moment, the projection looked like it needed to ground itself after that first, almost pre-programmed motion to summon the recording device. It looked confused. The projection observed the room until it finally shook its head and began its work, speaking in a male voice.</p>
      <p class="subsq">&quot;Deepdweller Dungeon Monitor number 322 reporting. Activation of generator successful. All readings confirming this is a natural dungeon.

      <p class="first first-in-section first-full-width">As Jake was teleported through the magic circle, he had to admit it felt quite different from the system transferring him. It was actually the first time he had experienced being teleported by non-system means. It was not an instant thing like when he was brought somewhere by the system, and he could actually feel himself move through space.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Not feel it well enough to actually get an understanding of how he was moved or any insight into the concept of space, but it was still an interesting sensation. Even if he couldn’t learn anything about how to use the concept, he did get a feeling he could resist it.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Well, not this teleportation circle in particular, as it was too strong. But it appeared that moving people through space like this was resistible to some degree. Good to know, as it would suck if Neil one day got mad at him and teleported him a hundred thousand kilometers away from Haven.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Getting home would be a pain.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Just as his considerations of the potential consequences of pissing off space mages appeared in his mind, so did his feet appear on the ground. The first thing he did was observe his surroundings, which were not as expected.</p>
      <p class="subsq">The ground beneath his feet was the borderline indestructible stone that the wall was made of, and he stood on what looked like an open field, based on his first assessment with his sphere. Well, besides a perfectly rectangular, all-black pillar a few kilometers ahead of him.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Moreover, when he looked to the sides, he did see what looked like walls far off in the distance. Hundreds of kilometers in each direction. When he looked up, he saw a ceiling far above too. It appeared he was now within a massive cube of indestructible stone with a large, ominous pillar.</p>
      <p class="subsq">This seemed like a perfectly safe and normal situation.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Spoiler warning: it wasn’t.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Jake observed the pillar a few kilometers away. He considered getting closer to have it be within his sphere, but his danger sense stopped him. It made him aware that the pillar would be the source of conflict.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Which turned out to be entirely accurate when he saw movement on top of the pillar. A humanoid figure rose up out of the pillar to stand atop it. It was human-sized, around two meters tall. It was entirely silver, and its body looked entirely human besides having nothing down there. While it had a regular face, it didn’t have any ears or hair.</p>
      <p class="subsq">He used Identify on it to confirm what it was.</p>
      <div class="alignment-block alignment-block-align-center">
        <div class="text-block">
        <p class="alignment-block-content alignment-block-content-center"><b>[Altmar Census Golem – lvl 150]</b></p>
      </div>
      </div>
      <p class="subsq">Right after identifying it, another message appeared—this one from the system itself, showing that this fight was indeed a natural part of the dungeon.</p>
      <div class="alignment-block alignment-block-align-center">
        <div class="text-block">
        <p class="alignment-block-content alignment-block-content-center"><b>New Dungeon Objective:</b> <b>Defeat the Altmar Census Golem.</b></p>
      </div>
      </div>
      <p class="subsq">Jake kept his eyes on the figure as it stood there, waiting. He knew this was the foe he had to defeat, yet he didn’t move right away. Because even now, his danger sense made him acutely aware that the moment he made a move to attack, things would get dangerous.</p>
      <p class="subsq">This golem was no pushover… Far from it.</p>
      <p class="subsq">He began preparing. His enemy was entirely metal… so he had no poison to use aside from his blood, which could serve as an all-purpose toxin—albeit a far less effective one against anything non-biological. Once Jake was done preparing everything, he took out his bow.</p>
      <p class="subsq">His hands were shaking as he nocked an arrow and drew the string, his eyes sharp and demeanor serious.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Jake was not shaking from fear or anxiety. No, it was something far different. Something that stemmed from his desire—no, avarice—for a good challenge:</p>
      <p class="subsq">It was pure anticipation.</p>
