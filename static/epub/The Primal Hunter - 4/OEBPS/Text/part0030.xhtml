      <p class="first first-in-chapter first-full-width">Conflict resolution is considered by many professionals to be an art that few will ever master. From smaller group projects to large enterprises, in the end, everything is made up of humans that have to interact for the cogs to turn. And when that happens, some friction is inevitable.</p>
      <p class="subsq">And that is in a school or corporate setting. In most cases, the worst-case scenario is just a lost job or a reprimand from upper management. However, in this new world, where a conflict would often spiral into a full-on fight to the death, conflict resolution only became even more important of an art to master.</p>
      <p class="subsq">William had never quite been one to care much about conflict resolution. Not because he didn’t know how to handle it. He knew exactly how to handle it in the new world. Have a conflict with another human? Just kill the conflict in the most literal sense possible.</p>
      <p class="subsq">For a guard to be taunting someone he clearly couldn’t read the power of was also highly questionable behavior.</p>
      <p class="subsq">At least all of this was Kim’s fast analysis of the situation that was quickly devolving into something that could only end in bloodshed. And not William's blood.</p>

      <p class="first first-in-section first-full-width">When William said his somewhat threatening words, the six men reacted as one would expect. Three of them drew swords, one drew a bow, and two more clearly prepared some kind of magic skill.</p>
      <p class="subsq">&quot;Please, there is no reason to fight!&quot; Kim practically yelled, trying to defuse the situation.</p>
      <p class="subsq">&quot;Won’t really be a fight either way,&quot; William snickered. &quot;It is their choice to walk towards death.&quot;</p>
      <p class="subsq">&quot;William, we agreed to avoid unnecessary bloodshed. We have nothing to gain from fighting them.&quot;</p>
      <p class="subsq">&quot;Oi, stop fucking ignoring me, or I’ll blow your head o—&quot;</p>
      <p class="subsq">Before the man could finish his sentence, he croaked. Something none of the men had seen was wrapped around his neck, cutting off air. His companion yelled at the newcomers as he tried to get it off in a panic.</p>
      <p class="subsq">&quot;What did you do!? Release him right now, or I’ll—&quot;</p>
      <p class="subsq">&quot;You’ll let us in? Great!&quot; William smiled as the suffocating man was released. &quot;See, negotiations are so easy!&quot;</p>
      <p class="subsq">The men looked at him in fright, but William didn’t bother giving them a chance to respond. &quot;Now, before I regret my very merciful decision, get the fuck out of my way. If I wanted you dead, you would be dead, so stop wasting our time.&quot;</p>
      <p class="subsq">Which turned out to work perfectly well, as the men just stood by while William walked into the camp. Kim followed silently with Seo in her arms. While she disapproved of his methods, she had to confess that they worked, and that sometimes power was the only thing enabling one to truly have it their way.</p>
      <p class="subsq">The camp itself was rather basic, and the populace less than energetic. Most just sat listlessly staring into thin air, while those slightly more motivated did basic tasks or practiced what was likely their profession.</p>
      <p class="subsq">None of them seemed to pay William and Kim any mind. The only thing that caught a bit of attention was the sleeping Seo, as children were relatively rare. A sad testament to the fate of the youngest generation.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Also, one of the men who had stood guard was now trailing along with them, yet keeping a good ten or so meters away. It was the first guy to speak and the one who seemed the most diplomatic.</p>
      <p class="subsq">&quot;Man, this place sucks,&quot; William said, not caring how loud he was. &quot;Who is this friend of yours anyway?&quot;</p>
      <p class="subsq">&quot;A friend from university. We shared quite a few classes and kept in contact afterward. She is also Seo’s godmother.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">&quot;Oh, another shrink?&quot; William asked, quite a bit of distaste in his voice.</p>
      <p class="subsq">While he liked Ms. Kim, he didn’t have the same love for the professional field of psychology as a whole, and she was perfectly aware of this. His trauma with other medical professionals was one of the most common subjects in their talks.</p>
      <p class="subsq">&quot;No, a normal doctor. Has her own practice. Or, well, she had her own practice before the system. I just hope you are right and that she survived.&quot;</p>
      <p class="subsq">&quot;Well, better than a shrink, I guess. So, does she know about me?&quot;</p>
      <p class="subsq">&quot;Of course not. You were my patient, William; confidentiality is the most basic of principles. And as I promised you, that confidentiality still stands.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">&quot;Fair enough.&quot; For some reason, though, he looked a bit annoyed at that.</p>
      <p class="subsq">After walking on a bit more, William had enough of their stalker. He turned back to the guy and said, &quot;Yo, since you’re following us anyway, at least tell us where this Mary woman is.&quot;</p>
      <p class="subsq">&quot;O… Okay. Mary is in the big white tent over there,&quot; he answered, pointing to what was indeed a big white tent.</p>
      <p class="subsq">&quot;Thanks, mate,&quot; William said as he returned to ignoring the man.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Kim had, of course, also heard the man and sped up her pace to make a beeline for the white tent. It was a lot like those party tents, and was one of the largest tents in the entire camp.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Getting closer, she began to smell something that had become all-too familiar after the initiation. Blood. The reason for this quickly became clear as they headed inside.</p>
      <p class="subsq">The tent could only be described as a makeshift hospital. Several mats had been laid out on the floor, with gravely injured people on all of them. So many that some were forced to just lay on the bare ground. Their wounds were mainly large gashes, clearly caused by claws or fangs.</p>
      <p class="subsq">One of the men, who was missing both an arm and a leg, had a woman desperately sweating over him with her hands on his chest. It didn’t take a genius to see that she was currently channeling some kind of healing skill.</p>
      <p class="subsq">She just managed to stop the bleeding before she fell over, barely being caught by another woman who stood by her side helping.</p>
      <p class="subsq">&quot;You need to rest and get your mana back; you can’t do more as you are right now,&quot; the woman supporting the healer said.</p>
      <p class="subsq">&quot;I know… but there is no one else.” She sighed as she stood up, still wobbly on her feet.</p>
      <p class="subsq">It was at this point that they turned around to see the three new arrivals in the tent. It was also the time that Kim saw the healer. Both their eyes opened wide.</p>
      <p class="subsq">&quot;Mary!&quot;</p>
      <p class="subsq">&quot;Kimmie!&quot;</p>
      <p class="implicit-break"></p>
      <p class="first first-in-section first-full-width">The two women sounded like schoolgirl friends seeing one another after a long summer break. Mary, still a bit unsteady on her feet, hurried over and hugged Kim, squashing poor Seo in between them.</p>
      <p class="subsq">&quot;What are you doing here!? Is something wrong with little Seo?&quot; Mary said as she looked down on the sleeping girl, alarmed, and let go of her old friend.</p>
      <p class="subsq">&quot;No, she is fine. I just put her to sleep with a skill,&quot; Kim answered as she looked her friend over. &quot;We came here to find you and see how you were doing. What happened here?&quot;</p>
      <p class="subsq">&quot;The situation is bad. There is a pack of powerful monsters that have their eyes on the camp. They never come directly, but they attack any team sent out. This here&quot;—she motioned to all the wounded people around her—&quot;is the result of trying to fight them off. And this is only the survivors.&quot;</p>
      <p class="subsq">&quot;Interesting,&quot; William said, interrupting their little reunion. &quot;What level are these monsters?&quot;</p>
      <p class="subsq">His question grabbed her attention, and she now noticed him for the first time. &quot;Oh, I am so sorry I didn’t see you. Are you with Kimmie?&quot;</p>
      <p class="subsq">&quot;Yes, this is William,&quot; Kim answered before he had had a chance to do so. &quot;He is someone from work that I teamed up with after we both returned to Earth.&quot;</p>
      <p class="subsq">&quot;Ah, good to meet you, William. I didn’t know she had such a handsome young colleague,&quot; Mary said teasingly.</p>
      <p class="subsq">This time, William answered before Kim could. &quot;Yeah, because she didn’t. For some reason, they never offered me a job.&quot;</p>
      <p class="subsq">&quot;Huh? Who are you, then?&quot; she asked, confused.</p>
      <p class="subsq">&quot;Just a good friend of hers. But we did meet at her work—that is true.&quot;</p>
      <p class="subsq">&quot;A patient, then?&quot; she said, nodding as if she was sure to be right. &quot;Taking care of your mental health even before the system was indeed important, and even more so now. Good to see that the younger generation is catching on.&quot;</p>
      <p class="subsq">&quot;Oh, I wasn’t a patient by choice.” He waved his hand dismissively. &quot;I am still pretty sure nothing was ever really ‘wrong' with me, per se. Not sure about now, though.&quot;</p>
      <p class="subsq">&quot;What do—&quot;</p>
      <p class="subsq">&quot;Shouldn’t we talk about these monsters you mentioned?&quot; Kim interrupted.</p>
      <p class="subsq">William looked at her and quickly got the hint not to overshare here and now, as he stood back and observed.&quot;True. So what are these things?&quot;</p>
      <p class="subsq">Mary looked between the two, a bit confused as she said, &quot;They are bipedal, cat-like creatures. They hunt mainly during the night, so we tried to attack them during the day… You see the result. We are at our wits’ end here, and the leadership is unsure how to proceed. They often don’t kill on purpose, but only injure… They seem to like playing with their prey.&quot;</p>
      <p class="subsq">&quot;Again, what’s their level?&quot; he asked, not really caring much for the details. If they were just a bunch of level 50 monsters, they wouldn’t be worth jack.</p>
      <p class="subsq">&quot;At least above 60.&quot;</p>
      <p class="subsq">William turned to see a new man had entered the tent. The highest-level individual he had seen so far since returning to Earth, sitting at level 39. Still well below William, but respectable, nevertheless.</p>
      <p class="subsq">&quot;You fought them?&quot; the young metal caster asked, now beginning to feel a bit excited.</p>
      <p class="subsq">&quot;Yes, I led the squad,” the man said. “There are five of them, all at a level I can’t identify. I can’t see your level either, but I have a feeling you are above mine. Am I correct?&quot;</p>
      <p class="subsq">Naturally, William had a skill to hide his own level. That was 101 of karmic magic.</p>
      <p class="subsq">&quot;I can neither confirm nor deny that accusation!&quot; William answered cheerfully. &quot;But I can confirm that I would very much like to go kill these little kitty-cats.&quot;</p>
      <p class="subsq">&quot;Wait—Milas, is that you?&quot; Kim suddenly butted in as she recognized the man.</p>
      <p class="subsq">&quot;Yes, I am sorry I didn’t introduce myself earlier. My wife and I arrived here with Mary.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">&quot;Wait, you two know each other?&quot; William jumped in once more.</p>
      <p class="subsq">&quot;They are my neighbors, and Kimmie also met them at a party of mine a few months back,&quot; Mary came in explaining.</p>
      <p class="subsq">&quot;Ah, that explains the two other thin threads of karma.&quot; William nodded, only confusing the others. &quot;Anyway, point me in the direction of the cats, then you guys can catch up while I go and do some pest control.&quot;</p>
      <p class="subsq">Milas looked quite unsure of what to do, but Kim gave him an affirming nod. &quot;Fine. They are normally in the block two or so kilometers north of here, up past the old hospital. They usually keep watch, so chances are they attack you before you even spot them.&quot;</p>
      <p class="subsq">&quot;Sounds easy enough—be right back,&quot; he said as he got up.</p>
      <p class="subsq">&quot;I must warn you… They are swift and strong. We barely survived an—&quot;</p>
      <p class="subsq">&quot;But you did survive. If they can’t even kill a bunch of weaklings like you, I doubt they are worth much. So just sit tight.&quot;</p>
      <p class="subsq">&quot;William, never be overconfident,&quot; Ms. Kim said sternly, adding in a bit softer of a voice, &quot;And be careful.&quot;</p>
      <p class="subsq">&quot;Yeah, yeah.&quot; He walked out of the tent with quite a big smile on his lips. <i>Guess I have to watch out, or she’ll reprimand me,</i> he thought to himself, making his smile only more genuine.</p>
      <p class="subsq">--</p>
      <p class="subsq">After he left, the four also followed, as Milas had brought another healer to replace Mary. They went to another tent not far away, where Anton began making some coffee from some beans they found while the two women talked.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Seo had also been woken up and was now playing around with the only two other kids in the entire camp.</p>
      <p class="subsq">&quot;So, who is he really?&quot; Mary asked as she kept on pushing to know more about William. &quot;Also, isn’t he a little young for you?&quot;</p>
      <p class="subsq">&quot;It isn’t like that, Mary…&quot; she said with an exasperated sigh. &quot;As he said, he is an old patient of mine. We made an agreement where I help him out, and he helps protect Seo and me.&quot;</p>
      <p class="subsq">&quot;Oh… ‘helping out,’ eh?&quot; she said, nudging her old friend with an elbow. &quot;What kind of ‘help’ are we talking about?&quot;</p>
      <p class="subsq">&quot;The psychological kind, Mary.&quot;</p>
      <p class="subsq">&quot;Okay, then, keep your secrets,&quot; she said, laughing. &quot;But you must admit he is quite the looker.&quot;</p>
      <p class="subsq">&quot;He is nineteen. He is also my patient.&quot; Kim sighed.</p>
      <p class="subsq">&quot;Are you sure he will be fine? Exactly how strong is he?&quot; Milas asked, placing two cups of coffee on the table.</p>
      <p class="subsq">&quot;In terms of fighting, he is more powerful than any I have encountered so far,&quot; Kim explained as she took a sip of the coffee, stats making the fear of burns redundant. “We have yet to meet any monster he couldn’t kill nearly instantaneously.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">&quot;How did he get so strong?&quot; Milas continued asking.</p>
      <p class="subsq">&quot;A lot of fighting, naturally,&quot; she answered promptly. It wasn’t her place to share.</p>
      <p class="subsq">&quot;Human or beast?&quot; Milas pressed with a serious look in his eyes.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Mary looked a bit shocked as she regarded him, while Kim also looked up at him rather abruptly.</p>
      <p class="subsq">&quot;Why would you ask that?&quot;</p>
      <p class="subsq">&quot;I have also done a lot of fighting, Ms. Kim. And when I stand in front of that young man… I feel like I am moments away from death. Like he is prepared to kill me and anyone else in the room at a moment’s notice.” He said the words as he shuddered a little, clearly off-put by William.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Sighing, Kim knew it wouldn’t make sense to hide it. &quot;Both.&quot;</p>
      <p class="subsq">&quot;Kimmie… Is he forcing you to…?” Mary asked, feeling horrible for her earlier jokes.</p>
      <p class="subsq">“No, nothing like that,&quot; she said, trying to reassure her friend. “We are in a partnership of sorts. William needs me, and I need him, so please don’t be worried. I have done nothing and will do nothing that is against my own will.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">They kept talking for a few minutes until Milas suddenly frowned at some commotion outside the tent. They all rushed out to see William returning, not a scratch on his body.</p>
      <p class="subsq">However, what was truly frightening was the bloody bag and the six heads of cat-like monsters on the ground.</p>
      <p class="subsq">&quot;Sorry for the wait, Ms. Kim,&quot; he said with a big smile. &quot;The kitties were a bit tougher than expected; one of them was even at level 77!&quot;</p>
      <p class="subsq">The entire camp was in an uproar. Everyone was afraid of such power—all except for one.</p>
      <p class="subsq">&quot;William! What the hell do you think you are doing!?&quot; Kim yelled as she stomped forward. &quot;There are kids here, so clean up that macabre mess right this instant!&quot;</p>
      <p class="implicit-break"></p>
      <p class="first first-in-section first-full-width">Time passed as they decided to stick with the group. Eventually, they encountered a bubble while traveling from their original camp, and within that bubble, a D-grade resided—along with many other powerful monsters.</p>
      <p class="subsq">William killed them all, except for the D-grade. He actually felt a bit nervous facing it, as it was far stronger than anything ever before. In the end, he only killed it after he was forced to do so. It said ten Pylons were already claimed when they got it, and based on how slow they had been, it was probably closer to the one-hundredth. After the Pylon was claimed, Milas was made City Lord and William the official owner, but…</p>
      <p class="implicit-break"></p>
      <p class="first first-in-section first-full-width">&quot;You aren’t going?&quot; Ms. Kim asked, confused.</p>
      <p class="subsq">&quot;Nah, I don’t see any reason to,&quot; he answered, shaking his head.</p>
      <p class="subsq">&quot;Why not?&quot;</p>
      <p class="subsq">&quot;It’s just a waste of time.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">Over the last months, William had made a lot of progress. He had slain only a few humans throughout this time, only hunting beasts and overall acting like a decent person… A lot of it was due to him following Ms. Kim’s advice and trying to resolve issues with other humans without using violence.</p>
      <p class="subsq">She had learned all about his tutorial. What he had done. It was unforgivable… yet her job was not to pass judgment, but make him understand why he did as he did and figure out a way to move forward. Yet there was one point he never addressed: how it had ended.</p>
      <p class="subsq">He just said that he went to train with his master. He said he &quot;died and went there,&quot; but he deflected when she asked for details, often just using humor or shrugging it off. Still, she saw him begin sweating a bit and looking uncomfortable whenever she made him think of it. She was confused for a long time, until one day where he finally had to sleep… and she heard it.</p>
      <p class="subsq">William woke up screaming in a cold sweat, his entire body shivering. In his sleep, he had talked about yellow eyes and a monster… She also came to notice that he often looked an extra time at everyone wearing an archer’s cloak. One time he yelped back when someone used some skill with dark mana, and he categorically avoided anyone whose level he couldn't see.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Kim could get him to talk about anyone but the yellow-eyed monster, and now it was clear he would be in the Congress. Which meant she would just have to go herself… and hopefully try to understand exactly what had happened.</p>
