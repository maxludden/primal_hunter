<p class="class_s8"><span class="class_sa3">I</span>rinixis lay on the large bed and stared at the overly decorated ceiling of the ridiculously expensive hotel. The silky blanket barely covered her body, and she felt like she was almost in a trance. Every second, she expected to wake up from some powerful illusion or cruel mental attack, but with every moment passing with nothing happening, the world was proven more and more real.</p>
<p class="class_s9">Turning her head, she saw the human lying beside her, hands behind his head, his eyes closed in apparent meditation. Whether he actually was meditating, she didn’t know, as he seemed to always be aware of his surroundings even when he was not supposed to be. Proven by him opening an eye and catching her peeking at him.</p>
<p class="class_s9">"Something on my face?" he asked, teasing Irin. Definitely revenge for all the teasing she had done recently.</p>
<p class="class_s9">Nevertheless, she couldn’t help but answer honestly. "No, it’s not that. It’s just that, you know… I thought it was a joke all the way up to when it suddenly wasn’t.” She still felt like everything was a bit surreal.</p>
<p class="class_s9">"What? You thought I was some eunuch?" Jake raised an eyebrow.</p>
<p class="class_s9">"The thought had crossed my mind for a moment after you missed every subtle and obvious hint I dropped. Seeing as you showed no interest in the elf girl at your residence either, I kind of assumed you weren’t very interested in anything like this.”</p>
<p class="class_s9">"Just had some complicated feelings on the matter.” He shook his head as he sat up.</p>
<p class="class_s9">Irin looked at him a bit and questioned something she had noticed before but never brought up. "That scar on your neck. Why is it there?<span id="page_392"></span>"</p>
<p class="class_s9">He had just evolved and should have been able to fix something like that. Even the Azure Dragonkin would be healed by the system when he evolved, so no matter what caused a scar, the system would heal it. The only way it wouldn’t disappear would be because the person wanted it to stay, either consciously or unconsciously.</p>
<p class="class_s9">Jake brought his hand to the small scar and smiled. "Just a reminder of this one time an old man nearly cut my head off. It was a good time, and I am looking forward to when a rematch feels right."</p>
<p class="class_s9">Irin was intrigued, but she didn’t ask more, as she felt he didn’t plan on sharing. Instead, she just snuggled up to him and enjoyed being there. Jake gladly threw his hand around her, and she wondered if he wanted to go for another round, but it seemed he just wanted to cuddle.</p>
<p class="class_s9">All fine by her, if a bit disappointing. Irin closed her eyes and laid her hand on Jake’s shoulder as he also relaxed.</p>
<p class="class_s9">Irin couldn’t help her internal questioning, which made this entire scenario feel so surreal. She truly had never expected to actually be where she was right now. She, a relatively low-ranked worker at the Order, in bed with the Chosen of the Malefic Viper. If it did ever happen that she managed to "snatch up" a powerful and influential person, she would have expected it to happen under far other circumstances. For her to perhaps just be one of many women who caught the eyes of some young master, ending up sharing a bed with hundreds. Not that she would have the undivided attention of a Chosen for an entire night.</p>
<p class="class_s9">To her Path, it truly was the equivalent of some C-grade crafter managing to create a peak-quality mythical weapon or a fighter killing a foe several times stronger than them.</p>
<p class="class_s9">As a succubus, she pretty much had to level her race through intimacy. She could also do it through practicing her racial magic or a bit of combat, but her Path was designed around what she and Lord Thayne had just done. It was a Path she had chosen herself, and she couldn’t lie and say it was one she didn’t enjoy. But, even so…</p>
<p class="class_s9">She almost felt guilty. Irin had always thought herself a very headstrong woman. She’d had to be to survive the demonic corporate world, but even so… She truly felt like she had taken advantage of the Chosen, even if he seemed to think it was the opposite for some inexplicable reason.</p>
<p class="class_s9">It somehow just felt wrong. It had been one night—a long night, granted—but still just one night. The Velvet Mistress, who had long figured out who Jake truly was, had already hinted at this <span id="page_393"></span>being a thing if she succeeded, but still. She couldn’t shake the thought that it was too much.</p>
<p class="class_s9">Irin had expected levels. It was her Path, after all. But… really?</p>
<p class="class_s9">Wasn’t it a bit too much to get nineteen fucking race levels from one round of fucking?</p>
<div class="class_sbh"><div class="class_sbd"><img src="image_rsrc71Y.jpg" alt="" class="class_sbb"/></div></div>
<p class="class_s8">See, Jake had to admit that he often made spontaneous decisions and didn’t always think his actions through before just jumping straight into things. When Irin had propositioned him outside of the hotel, a "screw it" switch had flipped, and he had gone and done just that.</p>
<p class="class_s9">The question is, did he regret this decision?</p>
<p class="class_s9">Fuck no.</p>
<p class="class_s9">The only thing he regretted was not doing it sooner. Lying there, cuddling with a succubus who would put any model from the world before the system to shame, wasn’t something he could really be mad at himself for doing. He also began to consider how stupid it was for him to reject Irin over and over again because he thought he was taking advantage of her.</p>
<p class="class_s9">Vesperia had been right that he needed to respect others’ feelings more. If Irin did not feel like Jake took advantage of her, then who was he to proclaim she was wrong? Even if he felt like that, it felt wrong to punish others for his own selfish feelings.</p>
<p class="class_s9">Not that he planned on being all selfless from now on by jumping into bed with everyone and anyone who wanted to. He liked Irin as a person, and he felt like he owed her—plus, she was clearly interested in him with a form of affection he could accept. She wasn’t like the Emberflight or whatever, who viewed him as a Bloodline Patriarch and nothing more. Irin instead just wanted him for those sweet, sweet levels.</p>
<p class="class_s9">Jake honestly felt like it was cheating, seeing her level grow by nearly twenty throughout the night. By the end, she had stopped rapidly progressing, so he assumed it wasn’t like she could spend a week with him and reach B-grade, but it was still insane what she had gotten so far.</p>
<p class="class_s9">It was only now he realized why Irin had been so persistent in her pursuit. Her dragging Jake to bed was her version of Jake killing the King of the Forest during the Tutorial. Records, levels, skills. It was her Path, and Jake wouldn’t lie… He was A-okay helping her progress. A more than willing helper, in fact.</p>
<p class="class_s9">Time passed, and they just lay there for a while longer as Jake enjoyed <span id="page_394"></span>the moment. He felt Irin move about a bit, rubbing all over him before she stared up at him and smiled devilishly. Jake stared back and smiled before he went in for a final round.</p>
<div class="class_sbh"><div class="class_sbd"><img src="image_rsrc71Y.jpg" alt="" class="class_sbb"/></div></div>
<p class="class_s8">The two walked out of the hotel later that day, Jake feeling pretty darn refreshed. Irin walked next to him, stuck in thought as they made their way into the street. Irin was a bit more restrained than before and, of course, nineteen levels higher than when they’d entered.</p>
<p class="class_s9">"People may question my sudden growth," Irin said in a worried tone. "Perhaps they may even suspect you. It is no secret I have spent time with you over these last few days and assisted you with shopping, and I had many people help me during this time. People who speculate for a living."</p>
<p class="class_s9">Jake just shrugged. "Who cares at this point? What would they do if they figured it out besides making some preparations and maybe spreading information to a few larger factions? I assume most would know that spreading it far and wide when the Viper and I intend to keep it hidden till the ceremony wouldn’t be in their best interest."</p>
<p class="class_s9">"I see your point," she said, nodding before sighing. Irin then turned a bit more serious and spoke in a severe tone, "I sincerely thank you, Lord Thayne, for humoring me during this night. It means more than you can imagine and is invaluable to my Path, and is truly a disproportionate reward for the assistance I have rendered thus far."</p>
<p class="class_s9">"Wait… really?" Jake said, looking at Irin with surprise. "You actually thought I did it just to reward you for something? I don’t really operate like that. I did it because I wanted to, not out of any sense of obligation or whatever. I sure as hell don’t view it as transactional… Ah, but don’t misunderstand; I am not looking for a relationship or anything, more just a casual thing when we both feel in the mood. You know, a friends-with-benefits kind of situation."</p>
<p class="class_s9">Irin stopped in the middle of the deserted street and stared at him. "I… I was under the impression this was a one-time thing."</p>
<p class="class_s9">"It totally can be, if⁠—"</p>
<p class="class_s9">"No, that isn’t what I meant!" she quickly tried to clarify. "Just that… Ah, you can be frustrating sometimes. You know that, right? Most people with your status have very high standards and don’t just casually make decisions like this. They need to consider the political impacts, how their allies, concubines, or even wives perceive things, and, of course, how their own faction would interpret their actions. Especially how their Pa<span id="page_395"></span>tron receives it matters, and… are you sure this is wise? The Malefic One…"</p>
<p class="class_s9">"Gave me a mental high-five the second we entered the hotel." Jake grinned, making Irin stare for a second. "Also, his thoughts on the matter are irrelevant to me. Sure, I would take his advice into consideration, but the Viper isn’t my boss."</p>
<p class="class_s9">"He is your Patron," Irin said in a rather serious tone.</p>
<p class="class_s9">"Eh, just a technicality. I call him a friend for a reason." Jake shrugged.</p>
<p class="class_s9">Irin took a second before she shook her head. "I truly do find it difficult to interpret the relationship between a Chosen and a Patron. It seems a lot more casual than I had anticipated, but if your attitude is accepted by the Malefic One and the system, I have no grounds to commentate."</p>
<p class="class_s9">"The Viper is fine with it,” Jake said nonchalantly. “The system? Not sure on that one, considering how it labeled me a heretic.”</p>
<p class="class_s9">"I see—wait, what did you say?" Irin said, confused. "The system labeled you a heretic before you were blessed?"</p>
<p class="class_s9">"No, it labeled me one after I was blessed," Jake clarified.</p>
<p class="class_s9">"But… you are the Chosen of the Malefic Viper," Irin stated.</p>
<p class="class_s9">"Yep. And a heretic. It’s all a bit complicated, but I don’t really see it as an issue, and neither does the Viper. Ah, but probably don’t spread it around too much. It would probably create a ruckus." Jake shook his head.</p>
<p class="class_s9">"How is that even possible…?" Irin muttered to herself. "And… why did you tell me?"</p>
<p class="class_s9">"In for a penny, in for a pound," Jake said, grinning. "You said early on you wanted to be my liaison or something at the Order of the Malefic Viper, right? Well, if you are supposed to act as one, then keeping something so huge a secret may just end up screwing me in the long run."</p>
<p class="class_s9">"You’re serious?" Irin asked skeptically.</p>
<p class="class_s9">"I know it is a bit weird, being both a heretic and a Chosen, but⁠—"</p>
<p class="class_s9">"No, not that. About being your official liaison?"</p>
<p class="class_s9">"Well, I need one, right?" Jake asked rhetorically. He knew he needed one, because fuck him if he would do all that political shit himself. "And I want someone I trust and actually like, not just some random person assigned to me by the Order."</p>
<p class="class_s9">"But…" Irin said doubtfully. "When I first approached you to be a liaison, it was due to you being a black token holder, not the Chosen of a Primordial."</p>
<p class="class_s9">"It’s just an offer, and one you are free to reject," Jake made clear with a smile. "Just think about it.<span id="page_396"></span>"</p>
<p class="class_s9">"I don’t really need to think about it," she said, shaking her head. "Not accepting would be foolish of me. I am just worried I won’t be able to properly do the job, and I am still only C-grade, so my abilities are limited, and I may end up becoming a liability."</p>
<p class="class_s9">"I believe in you," Jake said with a cheesy smile.</p>
<p class="class_s9">Irin smiled after a few seconds and shook her head helplessly. "Fine, but I will have to bring it up to my master and discuss if this is truly the best idea and, if I do it, how things will have to work."</p>
<p class="class_s9">"Understandable.” Jake nodded. It was common sense to always take a bit of time to think before approving an important agreement. "Now, the big question… Where to now? Any news on the bow?"</p>
<p class="class_s9">"Let me check," Irin said as she took out a token. "Ah, yes, I got a message two hours ago. They need your presence there since the item is Soulbound, but they sound pretty assured of success if they get your assistance."</p>
<p class="class_s9">"Great." Jake smiled, glad that even a magical token could be silenced when you were busy with other things. Or, well, in this case, the spatial storage had just been muted. "Let’s head over right away?" Irin nodded, but he saw how she hesitated for a moment, making him reconsider and stop. "You know, I think I can handle this one myself. I also have another place I want to stop by later, and I probably need to go there alone. If you want to come along, you can, but if not, then maybe go talk to your master now? Oh, that can also help you hide your sudden increase in levels, right? Reduces the chances of being randomly spotted by someone you know."</p>
<p class="class_s9">He really tried to give her the excuse to leave, having gotten the vibe that she wanted to. She noticed his attempt and smiled. "Thanks." She went forward and gave Jake a hug, and as she leaned in, she whispered in his ear, "Call me any time for anything, alright?"</p>
<p class="class_s9">Irin pulled away with a flirtatious smile before she took to the air and headed off.</p>
<p class="class_s9">"You know what? I just think I might," Jake spoke to himself after she was gone. Then he turned around and began heading towards the bowyer. As he walked towards the gateway he needed to take, he felt a certain someone poke at his consciousness.</p>
<p class="class_s9"><span class="class_s70d">"What’s up, Villy?"</span> Jake answered.</p>
<p class="class_s9"><span class="class_s70d">"I am experiencing some highly complicated emotions right now,"</span> the Viper answered. <span class="class_s70d">"On the one hand, it was about bloody time you bedded the succubus, and I can only commend the act, but on the other hand, I lost a bet <span id="page_397"></span>with Duskleaf, as I seriously thought you would get with the elf before the demon."</span></p>
<p class="class_s9"><span class="class_s70d">"How many fucking bets do you guys have going on?"</span> Jake asked with exasperation.</p>
<p class="class_sdx">"To clarify, when you say fucking bets, do you mean how many bets in total we have, or how many bets we have related to literal fucking?"</p>
<p class="class_s9"><span class="class_s70d">"I… actually don’t want to know,”</span> Jake muttered telepathically.<span class="class_s70d"> “So, did you want anything else?"</span></p>
<p class="class_sdx">"No, not really. I just wanted to praise your decision-making skills today, even if it was a far-too-long-delayed choice. You humans and your odd ingrained values. Oh, well, congratulations once more. See ya around!"</p>
<p class="class_s9">With those words, the Viper’s presence was gone. Jake shook his head at the snake god, wondering how everyone else could treat such a goofball with such reverence.</p>
<p class="class_s9"><span class="class_s70d">Oh well, time to get my bow, </span>Jake thought, shaking off the thought.</p>
<p class="class_s9">Today had been a good day so far, and he hoped it would continue to be a good day through getting his upgraded bow, as well as new or improved gloves.</p>
