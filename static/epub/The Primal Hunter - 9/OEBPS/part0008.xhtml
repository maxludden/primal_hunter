<p class="class_s8"><span class="class_sdk">J</span>ake instantly knew. He felt the awareness of sim-Jake slowly slip away as the bone katar began to show even more cracks. At the same time, Eternal Hunger hummed with power as if it was growing by the second, actively consuming something incredibly valuable—sim-Jake himself.</p>
<p class="class_s9">Despite knowing this had always been the plan, Jake still felt a sense of sadness. It was a weird sentiment, but he felt like he had become good friends with his other self. To have him disappear like this wasn’t something Jake wanted to see, but it had been inevitable from the beginning.</p>
<p class="class_s9">All Jake could do was help make sure the Legacy he left behind would be worth remembering for eternity.</p>
<p class="class_s9">The hydra kept attacking Jake as he picked up the pace. He dealt more damage, making the beast faster and stronger due to the berserker effect, and truly pushed himself. He was in the zone as sim- Jake did what he had to do. After a few seconds, Jake felt the full change. A humming of sorts went through his body, and the bone weapon let out an audible crack. The very next second, it began falling apart, forcing Jake to temporarily retreat.</p>
<p class="class_s9">Pieces of the broken weapon fell towards the marsh water below but never reached it. They turned to dust that rapidly began moving towards Eternal Hunger. The black bone dust swirled and entered the cursed weapon, which Jake felt growing more powerful with every wisp of energy absorbed. Its aura underwent subtle changes, and Jake felt a connection to it unlike anything he had before. Like it had become more than a simple weapon and truly a part of him<span id="page_17"></span>.</p>
<p class="class_s9">Then it hit in earnest, and an audible heartbeat sounded out from the core of his Bloodline… No… two heartbeats at the exact same time.</p>
<p class="class_sfv">*THUMP!* *THUMP!*</p>
<p class="class_s9">Knowledge. Records. Emotions. It all slammed into him like a truck. For a moment, Jake became unable to properly think and simply let his instincts take over. His body dodged through pure reflex, the hydra unable to hit him while Jake digested all that was streaming into his mind. His eyes were closed as he tried to focus, relying only on his sphere.</p>
<p class="class_s9">It was only now that Jake understood. Truly understood. Sim-Jake and Jake himself had wanted to keep parts separate for a reason. They were the same person but didn’t have the same personalities. They shared one body but could make different choices, seeing possibilities in combat and reading an opponent through their instincts. Yet, at the same time, they perfectly understood what the other would do in any given situation.</p>
<p class="class_s9">The hydra fell upon Jake again at that moment. His eyes opened as he saw the head descend… and he made a choice. A reaction. At the same time, a second choice was made. Two possibilities were valid, and two reactions were effective. Hence, both were chosen.</p>
<p class="class_s9">And both manifested.</p>
<p class="class_s9">Jake dodged backward at an incredible speed as his body took on a shadowy hue, accelerating him further. He drew his bow and released Splitting Arrow towards his foe. Simultaneously, a second shadowy Jake dodged to the side in melee range of the hydra and stabbed his katar into the leg of the beast.</p>
<p class="class_s9">Two figures spawned from one. Two possible realities manifested at once. One simulated, one true, yet both made real. At least for a moment.</p>
<p class="class_s9">The hydra responded quickly and ignored the arrows, clearly not having expected that attack. It instead focused on the one attacking its leg and promptly struck. Both heads came for it, but this version of Jake didn’t even try to dodge. One of the heads chomped down on Jake, but his body simply turned to black curse energy and disappeared, still leaving behind a deep and nasty wound.</p>
<p class="class_s9">Jake—the real one—landed on the ground shortly after, still trying to properly digest the skill. He had felt like he had been both, yet only one. Both had been real, yet not. Frowning, he kept going. <span class="class_s70d">There is more</span>. He wanted to test it again immediately; however, he also noticed what felt like an internal cooldown. No matter—he had time.</p>
<p class="class_s9">His opponent was still confused by what had happened as he retreated a bit, waiting for the skill to be ready once more<span id="page_18"></span>.</p>
<p class="class_sg">"That’s… How does it work?" Duskleaf asked with a frown. "Their auras felt exactly the same; it took me nearly a second to properly distinguish them. And⁠—"</p>
<p class="class_s9">"My dear disciple," Vilastromoz said, smirking, “just enjoy the show for once."</p>
<div class="class_sbh"><div class="class_sbd"><img src="image_rsrc71Y.jpg" alt="" class="class_sbb"/></div></div>
<p class="class_s8">A short while later, it was time for another go. Jake got in position before charging straight at the beast. Right as he got in front of the hydra, it tried to bite down. Once more, there were two responses. Dodging to both sides was correct. Hence, both choices were made. The "real" Jake dodged to the right, and his other version to the left. Both stabbed the side of the neck at the exact same time, both wielding Eternal Hunger, both using Fangs of the Malefic Viper to deliver poison, both absorbing energy through the mythical weapon.</p>
<p class="class_s9">With only one other head, the hydra had to choose. It went for the one on the right—the real Jake. He saw the attack descend… and realized that neither of the beast’s choices mattered. Because he could be either.</p>
<p class="class_s9">Once more, the beast only bit down on shadows as the real Jake stood on the left with his weapon in the neck of the beast. That was when he understood the second aspect.</p>
<p class="class_sdx">Both are real to the rest of the world… but I only need to be the outcome of one of them.</p>
<p class="class_s9">After the second use, Jake also noticed that the cooldown had gotten slightly longer, and the mental strain was detectable. Nodding to himself, he kept up the fight. A bit later, he tried to use the skill again. One version jumped back and shot an arrow, while the other stayed in melee once more, but this time, Jake chose to stay as the melee combatant. The arrows fired from his second version had still hit the hydra and dealt damage. The arrows themselves were gone with the shadow version, though, and Jake reckoned that should any arrows be in mid-air when he manifested as the other version, they would disappear.</p>
<p class="class_s9">By now, Jake was also beginning to feel the cost of the skill. Which was…</p>
<p class="class_s9">Pretty much nothing besides mental energy.</p>
<p class="class_s9">It drained a bit of mana each time, but it seemed to only really be the Shadow Vault aspect of the skill that had a cost. Not that Jake didn’t <span id="page_19"></span>know what the other version of himself consumed: It ran on pure curse energy. It used the massive pool of curse energy within Eternal Hunger to spawn his second shadowy version every time, making it highly efficient.</p>
<p class="class_s9">The only other cost was, of course, the mental energy, and in this respect, it was a bit taxing. Especially when switching places with his other version. Not that Jake complained… because he had a feeling he had only begun to figure things out.</p>
<p class="class_s9">Jake began to explore what skills his other version could use. Splitting Arrow? Worked. Gaze? Didn’t work. Powershot? Not really; it didn’t have enough time to charge, though it did look possible. Passive skills? All seemed to work, as the shadow copied Jake himself. Could he summon scales on it? Yeah, it copied those, but it didn’t do anything, as the shadow could always be destroyed in one blow. Touch of the Malefic Viper? Not enough time to channel, sadly. Things like Mark of the Avaricious Arcane Hunter also worked, though with few practical applications. Arrow of the Ambitious Hunter also worked just fine… Too bad it had no time to ever summon the arrow. Ah, and of course, Arrows of the Avaricious Arcane Hunter worked.</p>
<p class="class_s9">However, more than any other active skill, one worked far better than any other:</p>
<p class="class_s9">Descending Dark Arcane Fang.</p>
<p class="class_s9">It was instant, dealt good damage, and worked tremendously well with his shadow. The shadow also used Eternal Hunger, making it even better, as the weapon also benefited from Fangs of the Malefic Viper. Oh, on that note, the shadow could cheat. It could instantly transform Eternal Hunger into a bow when it became ranged—something Jake sure as hell couldn’t, as it took a long time for the weapon to change shape. Then again… the shadow was tied to Eternal Hunger, so it made sense. He estimated that "version" simply always had the bow and never transformed it, as it could only have either-or.</p>
<p class="class_s9">Jake’s battle against the hydra had quickly gone from a mere fight to transforming the peak D-grade into a test subject. The fight kept dragging on, and soon it had been nearly five hours since they began. Jake repeatedly retreated and even flew into the air a few times to reset, deactivating all his boosting skills and consuming a potion to recover. The hydra naturally also recovered before their bout continued. When he had nothing more to test… Jake decided to get serious and finish the fight.</p>
<p class="class_s9">For the first time, Arcane Awakening fully activated at 60% to all stats, flooding Jake’s body with power. He took out a vial of his best Hemotoxin and put it on his one remaining katar. Hemotoxin was <span id="page_20"></span>naturally chosen to impede the hydra’s regeneration at least a little and increase the damage done with the many blows he inflicted. Would it work with the shadow? He sure hoped so.</p>
<div class="class_sbh"><div class="class_sbd"><img src="image_rsrc71Y.jpg" alt="" class="class_sbb"/></div></div>
<p class="class_s8">"It won’t work with a crafted poison,” Duskleaf commented. “That would delve into the concept of creation, as it isn’t tied to his soul. If it does somehow apply, the effect would simply stop working the moment the second version disperses, resulting in⁠—"</p>
<p class="class_s9">"I told you already, didn’t I?” the Viper said, grinning. “Just enjoy the damn show.”</p>
<div class="class_sbh"><div class="class_sbd"><img src="image_rsrc71Y.jpg" alt="" class="class_sbb"/></div></div>
<p class="class_s8">The poison worked quite nicely. Jake’s clone appeared with a katar also coated in poison, and Jake had feared the effect would simply stop once the copy disappeared, but no, it remained. That hammered it home… Everything the clone did to affect the world became a reality.</p>
<p class="class_s9">This made him try to summon Arrow of the Ambitious Hunter and use a shadow with it already in hand, only to feel sad afterward. That didn’t work, maybe because it counted as another weapon, and Eternal Hunger was the only possible one? He also tried some other consumables, like using the shadow while holding a bottle of poison to throw, but that didn’t work either. The only-Eternal-Hunger theory had gotten stronger, though he hoped it would at least work with two melee weapons once he got his second katar.</p>
<p class="class_s9">Anyway, all stuff for later. The plan had been for testing to be over, and even if he kept doing a few experiments, that didn’t mean he hadn’t also upped the pressure to a new level. He had even hit with Arrow of the Ambitious Hunter, dealing some serious damage.</p>
<p class="class_s9">By now, the result of the fight was already clear. The hydra was struggling, and after fighting so long, Jake had a thorough read on everything it did. It was truly predictable and did not have the intelligence to switch up its tactics.</p>
<p class="class_s9">The massive hydra was covered in wounds, and after activating the second fully charged Arcane Charge from Mark, coupled with all the poison, it was also in serious pain and struggling to keep up. Without its berserker skill, it would already have fallen a long time ago.</p>
<p class="class_s9">Jake did encounter one issue here at the finishing line: <span id="page_21"></span>Crossing the actual finish line. He knew the hydra was close to death; he knew it was hurt all over… but it was also more dangerous than ever. Moreover, it regenerated at an insane speed, making its wounds heal in seconds. The only way to victory was to do a large burst of damage to finish the beast… and Jake had just the thing.</p>
<p class="class_s9">Throughout these hours and all this testing, something had accumulated and built up. For hours it had pooled, and, with his massive Perception, pooled a lot.</p>
<p class="class_s9">It was naturally his Hunting Momentum. Would it work with his shadow? Jake really had no idea… but fuck, did he hope it did.</p>
<p class="class_s9">Jake got ready, setting up the perfect opportunity. Half a minute passed as Jake kept up the status quo until, finally, a weakness displayed itself. The hydra had overextended, using both heads to try and catch him out. As it retracted both, Jake struck.</p>
<p class="class_s9">Momentum welled up from within as he charged. Right as he got close, both heads attacked again, and Jake reacted with a counter. Two heads, two targets to respond to… two reactions. Every shred of Hunting Momentum was consumed as Jake split into two, each stabbing Eternal Hunger toward one of the hydra’s two necks.</p>
<p class="class_s9">Both exploded in power and punched forward as Descending Dark Arcane Fang was used, releasing a torrent of energy. Two heads flew into the air as one of the Jakes disappeared and all Hunting Momentum was consumed. The two heads slammed heavily into the marsh, sending the water splashing. Jake stood ready for the hydra to do something, but it only stumbled a bit before falling over into the shallow water, joining its heads.</p>
<p class="class_shh">*You have slain [Two-Headed Hydra of Perennial Consumption – lvl 199] – Bonus experience earned for killing an enemy above your level*</p>
<p class="class_shk">*’DING!’ Class: [Avaricious Arcane Hunter] has reached level 196 - Stat points allocated, +10 Free Points*</p>
<p class="class_s9">Jake saw the notifications but didn’t pay them much heed. Instead, he closed his eyes and entered his Soulspace right away. He did not know what he expected to see, and honestly? What appeared before him was in line with expectations.</p>
<p class="class_s9">Inside the Soulspace, a lone figure sat with his legs crossed. A shadowy figure with indistinguishable features, giving off an intense curse <span id="page_22"></span>aura. Jake knew… this was sim-Jake… or was it Eternal Hunger? It was both… but…</p>
<p class="class_s9">Shaking his head, Jake finally checked the skill. Its name alone told him what sim-Jake had become. The moment he saw the rarity, he looked at the shadowy figure.</p>
<p class="class_s9">"We bloody did it, mate."</p>
<p class="class_sd"><span class="class_s70m">[Eternal Shadow of the Primal Hunter (Mythical)] – </span>Two choices, two realities, a single soul. A cursed shadow born and sustained by sin. Allows the Primal Hunter to use his instincts to respond to an enemy. Allows the Eternal Shadow to use his instincts to respond to an enemy. Both reactions will manifest at once as two realities are created. Both realities are real, but the Primal Hunter can choose his own soul’s reality and manifest it as such. The Eternal Shadow will experience the consequences of any reality not chosen. Upon activation of Eternal Shadow of the Primal Hunter, this skill allows both the Eternal Shadow and the Primal Hunter to embrace the shadows momentarily, vaulting in any chosen direction. Adds a large bonus to all stats dependent on the nature of the reaction while using Eternal Shadow of the Primal Hunter. Walk forth, Primal Hunter, your shadow forever eternal, waiting to strike.</p>
<p class="class_s9">The description offered little new information Jake had not already learned himself. Jake did not know what the baseline of a mythical skill was, but this felt like it hit the mark. It was probably the weirdest skill he had now, too… besides maybe Path of the Heretic-Chosen.</p>
<p class="class_s9">It was a skill that only Jake could have made and used. It relied on the concepts of the virtual world, his Bloodline, and shadows. The shadow aspect was not large, and Jake had also discovered that he didn’t even have to use the Shadow Vault functionality. In fact, there was rarely a reason to when he used it to attack. The Records of Shadow Vault had simply been fodder for the creation of the skill.</p>
<p class="class_s9">Jake was also sure of one thing… This skill was just the beginning. It was a baseline for what could be. Even now, he saw so many upgrade paths. <span class="class_s70d">All things in due time,</span> Jake thought.</p>
<p class="class_s9">Looking at the Eternal Shadow, Jake simply stared at it. He felt its attention on him, but he saw nothing he would identify as intelligence. It was a being of pure instinct, but no longer the mere instinct of the chimera. It was not called the Eternal Shadow of the Primal Hunter for nothing.</p>
<p class="class_s9">Jake smiled and nodded at the Eternal Shadow, surprisingly getting a <span id="page_23"></span>nod in response. His smile turned to a faint smirk. <span class="class_s70d">Guess there is a bit more to it.</span></p>
<p class="class_s9">Next, he turned his attention to everything else. The notification of something to do with a title gained, the change in Eternal Hunger, the dungeon coming to an end, and this annoying projection blabbering in the outside world about how awesome the Chosen of the Malefic Viper was.</p>
