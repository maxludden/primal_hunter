<p class="class_sdk1"><span class="class_s3ap">"<span class="class_s71g">T</span></span>hat must have been cathartic," the Sword Saint said after they had put some good distance between themselves and the northern arenas. "I take it no one is following us?"</p>
<p class="class_s11">"Nobody, as far as I can tell. And yes, it felt damn good to finally tell that fucker off.” But then Jake scratched his chin and, a bit embarrassed, asked, "But… eh… was that entire speech a bit overboard?"</p>
<p class="class_s11">"Hm, it was adequate and communicated what had to be said," the old man said, shaking his head.</p>
<p class="class_s11">"Good, good.” Jake nodded. He had pretty much made up the speech on the spot and let out a few pent-up feelings, so he wasn’t sure how it had come off.</p>
<p class="class_s11">"It was an interesting encounter, I must say," the Sword Saint commented. "More so than your speech, I believe your recent actions in relation to Vesperia are the real issue for this Yip and his Chosen. His attempt to try and find a solution that does not include killing you seemed genuine. I believe they fear the potential backlash of other factions if they kill you outright, and chances are they will attempt to discredit or spin that ability of yours, such as claiming that it cannot truly benefit others. Or perhaps saying you refuse to help anyone."</p>
<p class="class_s11">"I had considered that and also planned a counterstrategy of sorts to that bullshit story, but all of that is for after Nevermore. I truly couldn’t go and affect another evolution here and now even if I wanted to." Jake sighed. He was still annoyed at having to deal with Ell’Hakan, but he had also decided to take it seriously.</p>
<p class="class_s11">"In either case, today was a win,” the Sword Saint said. “You turned <span id="page_576"></span>the narrative from you pursuing him to him being the one chasing you. You threw the ball in his court to prove himself worthy of even competing with you. I do not doubt he can spin it to still be a position he can work from, but one thing I do believe is that you managed to change part of the discourse. You swept him up in your own tale, and forcing any storyteller to adapt and change his story to fit a new reality leaves it open for plot holes and mistakes.”</p>
<p class="class_s11">"Yeah,” Jake said, nodding. "Thanks, by the way. You handled things pretty damn perfectly. I did not expect that line about great-grandson-in-law. Sure threw me for a loop, and I guess my confusion and embarrassment was a great veil to block Ell’Hakan from gleaning anything."</p>
<p class="class_s11">"Ah, yes," the Sword Saint said with a nod, "but it was genuine. I had hoped something would develop there, especially after the two of you got along during the Treasure Hunt. Sadly, it seems you and little Reika aren’t meant to be."</p>
<p class="class_s11">Jake nearly tripped at the old man talking so frankly. "Well… sorry to disappoint. I only ever viewed her as a colleague and a friend."</p>
<p class="class_s11">"Perhaps for the best," the Sword Saint said with another nod. " I reckon she would not be accepting of any extramarital affairs with succubi or elves."</p>
<p class="class_s11">Glancing at the old man, Jake saw the cheeky smile, making him know the bastard was joking around. "You make it sound like I plan on building a harem."</p>
<p class="class_s11">The Sword Saint glanced back at Jake. "If you planned on having one, I would advise against it. It is exhausting and leads to needless drama if you want to keep everyone happy, and once children become involved, it is a nightmare. Better to settle for either one life partner or not truly commit to anyone."</p>
<p class="class_s11">"Wow, you almost make it sound like you’re talking from personal experience," Jake teased back.</p>
<p class="class_s11">The old man just smiled.</p>
<p class="class_s11">"Wait, seriously? You had a fucking harem?"</p>
<p class="class_s11">"Life is a journey,” the old man said in a fake sage tone. “Looking back and focusing too much on the past will never lead to happiness. Instead, we should focus on present issues and the recent past. Such as you owing me a new robe.”</p>
<p class="class_s11">"Hold up, let’s get back to the fact you apparently had a damn⁠—"</p>
<p class="class_s11">"Ah, would you look at that? The southern arenas are on the horizon.”</p>
<p class="class_s11">"You aren’t getting that robe," Jake muttered<span id="page_577"></span>.</p>
<p class="class_s11">"A sacrifice I will have to make."</p>
<p class="class_s11">Jake shook his head and walked silently, deciding to do something he probably should have handled earlier. At the very least, it should help take his mind off the exploits and the mental images of the Sword Saint in the past.</p>
<p class="class_s11">Walking, Jake finally got around to fixing the stats on his newly gained ring from the Altmar Empire. He had 5000 stat points to distribute but only around 2500 stat points till the cap, so he chose to only place 2500 of them for now. Considering Strength and Agility were already close to their caps, and Jake not feeling like he needed the other stats that badly, he made an executive decision.</p>
<p class="class_s11">+2500 Perception.</p>
<p class="class_s11">After that, he still had 59 stat points to the cap and decided to put 100 into Strength just for good measure to not have any waste. Due to the awesome design of the ring, he could always fix it later. Opening his status, he did a quick check-over.</p>

<p class="class_sdk1">Everything looked as expected, and his stats had all grown nicely, especially after he finally got fully capped out on equipment. Strength had significantly increased, with Perception naturally being the biggest winner. All in all, good stuff.</p>
<p class="class_s11">He closed his status once they made it to the arenas. As with the northern ones where they had met Ell’Hakan, this was an entire complex, but also as with Ell’Hakan, it wasn’t hard to find the one they were looking for. Because in this place, there was also one arena with far more attention than any of the others, and as Jake heard someone mention a Unique Lifeform, it wasn’t hard to figure out what their three other party members were up to.</p>
<p class="class_s11">Jake and the Sword Saint quickly confirmed their suspicions after entering the stands of the large colosseum and seeing the creature that was down below with an entire party of challengers standing before him. Or, well, three people were standing. Another was embedded head-first in a wall, and the fifth one was just two legs sticking out of a large mound.</p>
<p class="class_s11">All of the challengers were humans, and the last three still standing were a man with a large sword, a woman with a spear, and a mage of some kind.</p>
<p class="class_s11"><span class="class_s70d">"I had expected more of the archer, though perhaps my view is skewed,"</span> the Fallen King said as he floated slightly off the ground opposite these humans. <span class="class_s70d">"Nevertheless. Continue."</span></p>
<p class="class_s11">Raising a hand, he released a blast of force toward the mage. Jake was surprised to see the guy capable of teleporting away in time, and he reappeared nearly a hundred meters away, then slammed his palms together to form a massive, pillar-like spear of earth above him.</p>
<p class="class_s11">The King ignored him and pointed at the sword-wielding warrior running straight at him. The warrior braced himself as a blast of force knocked him backward, but he managed to cover for the woman with her spear. Ice condensed all around her as she stabbed forward, only to hit a <span id="page_580"></span>transparent barrier. The entire spear bent from the impact, and as the King swiped his hand, the woman was hit by an invisible blast, sending her flying. Just then, the pillar of earth from the mage also struck, but it simply exploded into shards of rock, not leaving a single nick on the barrier.</p>
<p class="class_s11">Despite being knocked away, the warrior with the sword had rapidly recovered, and pure energy exploded from his body as he jumped and cleaved the sword downwards onto the barrier of the King. Once more, the Unique Lifeform didn’t even budge. The warrior’s eyes opened wide as the Fallen King spread out his arms and formed two golden hammers.</p>
<p class="class_s11">"A melee battle it shall be."</p>
<p class="class_s11">It wasn’t a battle. Jake and the Sword Saint proceeded to watch the Fallen King manhandle the three remaining members, and less than a minute later, they all teleported out as Jake heard the chatter from all around.</p>
<p class="class_s11">"Truly a Unique Lifeform… Is that barrier even breakable by a C-grade around his own level?" someone questioned out loud.</p>
<p class="class_s11">"Those five were all considered pretty damn good; they won four party battles just yesterday," another chimed in.</p>
<p class="class_s11">"We are looking at the pinnacle,” a dragonkin said, shaking his head. “Comparing that monster to a bunch of humans just isn’t fair.”</p>
<p class="class_s11">The Sword Saint raised an eyebrow before throwing Jake a glance. "Would you mind if I go retrieve the King as you find Sylphie and Dina?"</p>
<p class="class_s11">"Sure thing," Jake said. He felt Sylphie through their Union Oath and knew she was halfway across the filled stands. He began to make his way over, trying not to bump into anyone as he watched the arena below.</p>
<p class="class_s11"><span class="class_s70m">"Another glorious victory by the Fallen King!"</span> an announcer of sorts spoke. <span class="class_s70m">"Are there any more challengers, or will the Unique Lifeform remain undefeated? Unchallenged? Remember, full parties are allowed!"</span></p>
<p class="class_s11">Jake heard a bunch of comments from people about how no one wanted to go embarrass themselves before the announcer spoke again.</p>
<p class="class_sfv1">"Ah, we have a challenger! An individual, no less!"</p>
<p class="class_s11">"Arrogant idiot," someone muttered as Jake walked by, making Jake shake his head.</p>
<p class="class_s11">On the platform below, the Sword Saint appeared, standing opposite the Fallen King.</p>
<p class="class_sfv1">"Let the battle begin!"</p>
<p class="class_s11">Although everyone seemed to expect the King to blast the weak-looking old man away the moment the announcer declared the match <span id="page_581"></span>had begun, the Unique Lifeform instead spoke, <span class="class_s70d">"Ah, you are done dealing with the invader?"</span></p>
<p class="class_s11">"Yes, I came to fetch you," the old man said, smiling.</p>
<p class="class_s11"><span class="class_s70d">"Very well,"</span> the Fallen King said with a nod. <span class="class_s70d">"However, it would be a waste to give up a chance like this. I know of the power wielded by the others, but please, humor me. Let me feel the blade of the human who dares call himself the Sword Saint."</span></p>
<p class="class_s11">The Sword Saint smiled as he drew his sword. Instantly, the atmosphere in the arena below changed, and Jake felt a collective gasp from the many D- and even C-grade onlookers from all around him. Even a few people above C-grade suddenly showed quite an interest.</p>
<p class="class_s11">Jake heard comments about how not a single person had managed to pierce the barrier of the Fallen King… nor make him even move. Which was why what came next was surprising to everyone.</p>
<p class="class_s11">Below, the swordsman disappeared. He next appeared right in front of the Fallen King, and the Unique Lifeform once more allowed his opponent to strike. Jake saw the Sword Saint faintly smile as he grabbed the sword with both hands and stabbed forward. As his blade moved, Jake saw countless droplets form in a line in front of it, and everything seemed to shift.</p>
<p class="class_sdx1">Time magic? With droplets?</p>
<p class="class_s11">The Sword Saint’s thrust made the entire arena shake, and the barrier reacted like it had been hit by thousands of small attacks every millisecond. It vibrated before hairline cracks formed, and it finally shattered into a million wisps of golden energy. The King responded by moving his ivory claw, and as it was clad in gold, he blocked the sword.</p>
<p class="class_s11">Despite his efforts, the strike sent the Fallen King sliding back a dozen meters before he stabilized himself. The Unique Lifeform looked at the palm of his hand and saw the faint nick in the otherwise pristine ivory claw.</p>
<p class="class_s11"><span class="class_s70d">"Indeed, another monster along with the Hunter,"</span> the Fallen King said in a satisfied tone. He then loudly spoke, <span class="class_s70d">"The battle ends here; I see no value in wasting resources and risking injury to either myself or my party member."</span></p>
<p class="class_s11">The Sword Saint nodded, and a moment later, both were teleported out of the arena to quite the fanfare as numerous people discussed the bizarre situation. Jake just smirked and shook his head once he finally found Dina and Sylphie, who seemed to get along quite well. Dina had even made a branch grow out of one of the benches on the stands for Sylphie to perch on<span id="page_582"></span>.</p>
<p class="class_s11">Jake greeted them and promptly had a bird on his shoulder. Dina also stood up and nodded at him. After that, it didn’t take long to group up with the Fallen King and the Sword Saint, even if it was a bit annoying that they were surrounded by what Jake could only categorize as fans. A lot of them questioned who else was in their party, and one guy even offered to pay if they would assist him.</p>
<p class="class_s11">However, when they saw Jake and the others walk over, they all backed off. Jake released his aura and flared his Blessing, and quickly, everyone knew the two were with Jake and his party. The Sword Saint thanked the people around him, yet the King disregarded them all as both followed Jake out of the arena.</p>
<p class="class_s11">Their group of five quickly made their way through Nevermore City, not getting caught up in anything more that was happening. There were markets, factions trying to recruit with stalls, and of course, the many arenas. Not to mention other things regularly found in cities, like gambling houses, hotels, brothels, and a slew of entertainment options. Recruitment agencies were also a big thing, but luckily they left Jake and the others alone. In fact, no one bothered them as they did a few teleports to get closer to the entrance of Nevermore.</p>
<p class="class_s11">The last teleport took them about ten kilometers from the edge. For ten kilometers or so, all around the pit, not a single building existed. Only black obsidian marred the ground, and without further ado, their party of five made the trip.</p>
<p class="class_s11">In the speed department, it wasn’t that surprising to see Dina be the slowest, but she was still plenty fast. The King was second slowest, with the Sword Saint third, putting Jake and Sylphie at the front. Considering the ten-kilometer distance, it didn’t take them long, but Sylphie still bragged about being first.</p>
<p class="class_s11">As one, they all stopped a few meters from the large pit.</p>
<p class="class_s11">They found themselves standing at the edge of an endless cliff that seemed to stretch infinitely out to both sides. Considering the sheer size of Nevermore and the ring around the pit, it didn’t look circular at all, even with Jake’s high Perception. The curvature was simply not significant enough for a C-grade to even notice.</p>
<p class="class_s11">As they stood before the pit, the voice of Villy descended.</p>
<p class="class_sdx1">"Good luck in there, mate. Nevermore will be the first true challenge where you compete with not only your own universe, but the multiverse as a whole. Every faction, every individual talent. Prove to them that you are worthy of sitting atop the food chain and exist firmly at the peak of your <span id="page_583"></span>weight class. Prove to them you are the monster I believe you to be. Ah, but more than anything… have fun and enjoy yourself!"</p>
<p class="class_s11">Jake smiled to himself and sent a mental affirmation to Villy. <span class="class_s70d">"Thanks, mate. Just focus on your own matters, alright? I got the mortal stuff handled."</span></p>
<p class="class_s11">Villy seemed amused at his concern but still acknowledged Jake’s words.</p>
<p class="class_s11">After they had all been standing there for a few seconds, someone finally spoke.</p>
<p class="class_s11">"I take it we are meant to jump in together?" the Sword Saint asked, also staring down.</p>
<p class="class_s11">"Seems to work that way," Jake said with a shrug.</p>
<p class="class_s11">"I do wonder who the first was to discover this," the old man said, nodding as he spoke in a respectful tone. “A brave soul, indeed, choosing to leap into an endless abyss.”</p>
<p class="class_s11">"Or a complete moron," Jake said, grinning.</p>
<p class="class_s11">"Entirely possible.” The Sword Saint chuckled as he shook his head.</p>
<p class="class_s11">Jake just smiled and looked at the others behind him. "You all ready?" Once he got confirmations all around, he turned to look down the pit. "Then let’s fucking go."</p>
<p class="class_s11">Jake stepped over the edge without hesitation, and within a second, four more figures followed him and fell into nothingness. The last thing he heard before he subtly felt the world fade away was a final whisper from the Viper.</p>
<p class="class_sdx1">"Happy hunting."</p>
