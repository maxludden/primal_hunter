<p class="class_s8"><span class="class_sdk">T</span>he two overwhelming auras clashed in mid-air, reality itself vibrating from the metaphorical dick-measuring contest of two beings approaching the apex. Jake saw several people he suspected to be gods in the crowd frown and slowly back away, a few even teleporting away to avoid getting caught in a fight far beyond their level.</p>
<p class="class_s9"><span class="class_s70m">"Bold of you to dare come here,"</span> the Viper spoke, his voice calm yet with rage seething right beneath.</p>
<p class="class_s9"><span class="class_s70m">"Bold… Sure, we can use that word."</span> Yip smiled and tilted his head. <span class="class_s70m">"Though I do wonder why you would think that. Is there something wrong with me coming here unannounced? Besides, what are you going to do about it? As I see it, you only have two choices. Either you can be nice and listen to my well-wishes… or…"</span> He paused and looked to the crowd below, giving them a pitying glance<span class="class_s70m">. “You could lose your shit again and massacre everyone who was so silly as to respond to your invitation?"</span></p>
<p class="class_s9">When the Viper’s presence flared with bloodlust, Jake took a step back. He moved back together with Vesperia and grouped up around Sandy and Viridia, where he helped cover them with his own presence so they wouldn’t be too affected. Sandy and Vesperia both seemed thankful as all three of them observed the two gods with bated breaths.</p>
<p class="class_s9"><span class="class_s70m">"Are you willing to risk that I would do just that?"</span> the Malefic Viper asked as energy gathered in his surroundings, amplifying his presence further. For a moment, it looked as if the other god would get suppressed, but...</p>
<p class="class_s9"><span class="class_s70m">"Yes, I am,"</span> Yip responded confidently, his aura also flaring even <span id="page_476"></span>more. Once more, they clashed, and once more, they were equal. <span class="class_s70m">"This is our second meeting, and while the first was simply a greeting, today is a declaration. You had a speech, didn’t you? My turn.</span></p>
<p class="class_sfv">"The Order of the Malefic Viper has existed only on the merits of its broken legend for far too long. It is an old story that has waited for a new chapter for far too long. Now, the old forgotten main character returns and thinks he can just pick up the story again, making himself fit into the world once more."</p>
<p class="class_s9">As Yip spoke with confidence, his aura seemed to grow.</p>
<p class="class_sfv">"A foolish presumption. While your story has been stagnant, the multiverse has been through several arcs, growing and improving with every story beat hit, every event passed, and every new character coming into their own. What have you truly done? Have you grown stronger? Yes. But it isn’t enough. You have wallowed and drowned in your own pity. Meanwhile, your old enemies have grown and multiplied, their grudges festering. You, oh dear Primordial, will come to see that your infallibility is far from fact. With all that said, it would be unkind to rain too much on your wonderful return celebration… and I did promise a present, didn’t I?"</p>
<p class="class_s9">The god took out a sheet of golden parchment and began infusing energy into it.</p>
<p class="class_sfv">"Now, you are known as a god who loves knowledge, so what gift is better than letting you be the first to know?"</p>
<p class="class_s9">In the air, a giant contract manifested, the words written in some runic language. Jake got the feeling one wouldn’t even need a translation skill to understand it. These were words written directly by the system for all to comprehend.</p>
<p class="class_s9">As all looked upon the golden words, Yip grinned and declared, <span class="class_s70m">"From this day forth, I, Yip of Yore, and my followers have officially signed an alliance with Valhal, subject only to expiration through the death of the Malefic Viper. Personally signed by Valdemar and Gudrun both."</span></p>
<p class="class_s9">A shockwave of gasps went through the entire hall, and within seconds, several figures teleported away from all over. Entire groups were suddenly gone, but most simply stayed there in disbelief at Yip of Yore’s words. Jake was also surprised as he kept staring at the contract. The wording was loud and clear, saying exactly what Yip had declared. It was a contract binding Valhal and Yip in an alliance, with the contract being between him, Valdemar, and Gudrun<span id="page_477"></span>.</p>
<p class="class_s9">Villy also stared at the contract in disbelief before his face warped into an angry visage. <span class="class_s70m">"So that bastard has finally made his intentions clear. So what? Do you think that will matter?"</span></p>
<p class="class_s9">As the Viper rose into the air, the entire world started to change color. A faint dark green aura spread all over, but as it got close to Yip, it stopped. Monochrome energy spread out of Yip, beating back the colors of the Viper’s presence and matching him in power. The false sky, which was the ceiling of the massive hall, began to crack, and it looked like the heavens themselves were breaking. Several of the gods still in the crowd sprouted barriers to defend their individual sections, and right next to Jake, a figure appeared. Jake recognized him as the Lord Protector, and the scalekin instantly released a barrier to protect the ones on stage.</p>
<p class="class_s9"><span class="class_s70d">They’re actually going to fight?</span> Jake questioned. If they did…</p>
<p class="class_s9">Just as it looked like the two gods were about to clash, a new voice suddenly drilled into the minds of everyone present.</p>
<p class="class_sfv">"Quite enough now, isn’t it?"</p>
<p class="class_s9">A massive web of strings appeared in the sky between the Viper and Yip. Suddenly, all the strings vibrated and snapped, rebuffing both gods and sending them stumbling back. Right in the epicenter of their clashing auras, where all the strings had just been, a smiling old man appeared.</p>
<p class="class_s9"><span class="class_s70m">"Yip of Yore… I believe you are done saying your piece?"</span> the Primordial asked the far younger god.</p>
<p class="class_s9">Yip grinned. <span class="class_s70m">"A fellow Primordial coming to the rescue of his old pal? Touching."</span></p>
<p class="class_sfv">"There is a time and place for everything. It is neither for a fight, and you know that."</p>
<p class="class_s9">Yip tilted his head and looked at Eversmile for a few moments. <span class="class_s70m">"You know… out of all the Primordials, you are the one I have the hardest time pinning down. Always secretive, always hidden. Your motives are a mystery to me, and I can’t even remember the last time I heard about you fighting anymore. Perhaps the Viper is not the only relic of the past?"</span></p>
<p class="class_s9">Eversmile’s signature smile deepened. <span class="class_s70m">"The reason you never hear about my fights is rather elementary."</span> Two auras had dominated the entire hall before the third appeared. The monochrome color and dark green aura were both instantly pushed back, once again rebuffing both gods.<span class="class_s70m"> "I never leave bad karma."</span></p>
<p class="class_s9">Jake had to hold himself back from gaping as he realized… Eversmile was on another level. His aura surpassed Villy’s and Yip’s by a huge margin… but… something still felt off to Jake<span id="page_478"></span>.</p>
<p class="class_s9"><span class="class_s70m">"Are you truly willing to stand in my way?"</span> the Malefic Viper said with a face full of anger.</p>
<p class="class_s9">Jake’s expression changed into one of confusion as he felt the auras clashing. A memory appeared in his mind, recalling the first time he’d met the Viper within his divine realm. At that time, the Viper had tried to scare him and⁠—</p>
<p class="class_s9"><span class="class_s70d">"Don’t lose your cool,” </span>the Viper spoke in his mind. The Primordial was calm, despite looking filled with rage while floating above.</p>
<p class="class_s9">Jake quickly complied, returning to just looking confused and surprised beneath his mask. While reading his impression was borderline impossible, he wouldn’t put it above gods.</p>
<p class="class_s9"><span class="class_s70m">"I should be saying that, shouldn’t I?"</span> Yip of Yore answered the Viper. <span class="class_s70m">"But alright. I shall respect the true Primordial and take my leave for today."</span></p>
<p class="class_s9">He then turned to Jake and looked straight at him. Jake felt the Lord Protector flinch and move into a defensive position as the god above spoke again.</p>
<p class="class_s9"><span class="class_s70m">"It wouldn’t be proper for our final clash to take place before that of our Chosen, now, would it? To ruin his story would be unbecoming."</span> Yip smiled at Jake. <span class="class_s70m">"Give him a proper challenge, would you? I at least expect you to prove a worthier opponent to my Chosen than your Patron is to me. I look forward to seeing how you do at Nevermore compared to mine. Ah, but considering what you accomplished with the True Royal, perhaps simply slaying your Patron and allowing you a better future would be preferable? No matter what, I must implore you to leave your broken Path behind and find one more worthy of your unique talents."</span></p>
<p class="class_s9">With those words, he snapped his fingers, and space all around him twisted. He threw a final glance towards Eversmile and then the crowd. <span class="class_s70m">"Excuse my rudeness today. I simply find it disgusting that so many chose to show up in support of a god whose most significant accomplishment is the biggest disaster in the history of the multiverse. All because he threw a pathetic, childish tantrum. Let’s hope you all realize there are those not worthy of reverence."</span></p>
<p class="class_s9">In the next moment, space collapsed, and he was gone, leaving only Eversmile and Villy left in the air.</p>
<p class="class_s9">As Eversmile and Villy looked at each other, the Primordial of karma spoke, <span class="class_s70m">"Fighting here would only have sown bad karma by slaughtering all those present. Do not take my interference as any kind of <span id="page_479"></span>approval of what you are doing. You still hold the title of Primordial… Prove you are worthy of it."</span></p>
<p class="class_s9"><span class="class_s70m">"Are you saying I am not?”</span> the Viper shot back.<span class="class_s70m"> “Are you saying you would be willing to fight me elsewhere?"</span></p>
<p class="class_s9">Eversmile’s grin grew. <span class="class_s70m">"No. Ultimately, you are still the Malefic Viper. It would be a needless risk. Now, please, enjoy the rest of your ceremony."</span></p>
<p class="class_s9">With that, he was also gone, leaving just the Malefic Viper floating alone. The atmosphere was significantly different from before, and several groups had disappeared due to hidden gods teleporting themselves and others away during the commotion.</p>
<p class="class_s9">Villy scoffed as he looked around the hall. <span class="class_s70m">"This part of the ceremony is over. We will proceed as planned, with the discussions of the Nevermore party happening in the next section. If you choose to believe the words of some upstart, you are free to leave."</span> Then the Viper appeared on the stage among Jake and the others. <span class="class_s70m">"We shall reconvene in the inner chambers in an hour. Show up if you dare."</span></p>
<p class="class_s9">Jake watched the Lord Protector teleport away with Sandy, Viridia, and Vesperia, and a second later, the Viper teleported him away, too.</p>
<div class="class_sbh"><div class="class_sbd"><img src="image_rsrc71Y.jpg" alt="" class="class_sbb"/></div></div>
<p class="class_s8">Yip of Yore appeared within the void, a relaxed smile resting on his face. He collected himself as all that had happened ran through his mind, and he felt the power rushing through his body. The story was growing, and his aura grew further as the narrative flowed through his soul.</p>
<p class="class_s9">"That went rather well, if I say so myself," he spoke out loud into the vast nothingness.</p>
<p class="class_s9">"Had he made a move, that would have made you come out looking better and created a more potent karmic justification for what is to come," a second voice said as Eversmile appeared. Yip’s dear, scheming partner.</p>
<p class="class_s9">"He seems capable of some level of self-control," Yip said. "Though this appearance of the True Royal and this unique ability of his Chosen does throw a spanner in the works. Having Ell’Hakan kill him outright might result in unnecessary backlash from certain factions."</p>
<p class="class_s9">"Perhaps. Perhaps not. Some will celebrate it happening, while others will view it as a gross crime against the multiverse. Ultimately, it all comes down to the narrative you foster. If the Viper’s Chosen is painted as a true <span id="page_480"></span>villain who would never have helped any factions anyway, those who would mourn his passing are significantly reduced."</p>
<p class="class_s9">"You truly don’t like the mortal, huh?" Yip raised an eyebrow. "Messed up that little experiment of yours too much?"</p>
<p class="class_s9">"He introduced several unpredictable variables and derailed the original objective, even during his tutorial. He is a chaotic element in any experiment." Eversmile shook his head.</p>
<p class="class_s9">"Heh, I will ultimately leave it up to my own Chosen. If anyone can convince the Viper’s to switch sides, it will be him. Imagine that… The Viper shown to be so deplorable that even his own Chosen abandons him and becomes a heretic? That… Oh… " The storyline manifested in Yip’s mind, and the Records of the multiverse allowed him insight. He grinned, sensing there was more to the Chosen than met the eye. "It appears there is already doubt in his mind about the Viper. His reverence for the Viper is far below what one would expect, indicating he isn’t quite as devoted as he should be. Not surprising, considering my Chosen isn’t the most loyal either. These kinds of pinnacle geniuses tend not to be. But he… He gives off Records far more akin to that of a heretic."</p>
<p class="class_s9">Eversmile nodded. "Interesting. However, if you do wrest him away, I must warn you. Vilastromoz held back his aura today, potentially trying to lead you into rushing the story and initiating the final confrontation too early. Had you fought today, it would have ended badly for you.”</p>
<p class="class_s9">“I am fully aware, and I shall not make the final move before the story arc reaches its zenith," Yip said, the power rushing through him simply from imagining it. “Only then shall the finale play out, and my power will reach its peak.”</p>
<p class="class_s9">"Good, as long as you are aware. This will be the one time I will help you, as per our agreement." Eversmile nodded. "If you wish for assistance again, proper recompense will be required."</p>
<p class="class_s9">"Just one thing," Yip of Yore said, stopping Eversmile before he left. "Yes or no… Do you wish to see me realize my narrative?"</p>
<p class="class_s9">Eversmile squinted before nodding. "Yes."</p>
<p class="class_s9">"To clarify further, you wish to see me kill the Malefic Viper? Your fellow Primordial?"</p>
<p class="class_s9">"Yes," the Primordial answered, this time without a hint of hesitation.</p>
<p class="class_s9">Yip grinned, feeling great. "Once more, thanks for your assistance."</p>
<p class="class_s9">Eversmile teleported away without saying anything more.</p>
<p class="class_s9">Yip of Yore was not stupid. He knew the Malefic Viper was a schemer and that he had plenty of plans. He knew the Viper had been playing up his emotions today. He knew the Viper had grown far more powerful <span id="page_481"></span>than he had revealed. He even knew that Eversmile was helping him with his own ulterior motives, and that Valhal had other thoughts than simply trying to use him to kill the Malefic Viper.</p>
<p class="class_s9">The reason he wanted to clarify with Eversmile was relatively simple. Eversmile had this one particular thing where he never lied. It was his Path to not lie when directly asked, and he would feel a tangible blowback if he did so, especially to another god at Yip’s level. Did he still plan things on his own? Yes, but that was fine.</p>
<p class="class_s9">Ultimately… it didn’t matter. Yip of Yore had claimed the narrative, and even the Malefic Viper purposefully trying to mess up the story had been part of the plan from the very beginning. His scheming was simply the Viper playing his assigned role. Besides, no matter how much the Viper planned, there was one hole in all his plots. One major flaw in every plan he made.</p>
<p class="class_s9">His Chosen.</p>
<p class="class_s9">An impulsive, emotional, and thoughtless person who, as Eversmile had mentioned, was indeed chaos incarnate. Jake Thayne was, based on all Yip had seen, quite the opposite of a schemer. He was more akin to Valdemar, a warrior by heart with an unshakeable will and stoic demeanor. Simple-minded and focused, which didn’t allow him to see the full picture.</p>
<p class="class_s9">Meanwhile, Ell’Hakan was a schemer through and through. He had grown up with both guile and brawn and was, in Yip’s eyes, nearly perfect. He had everything one would expect of a genius, and the expectations of his performance in Nevermore were high.</p>
<p class="class_s9">Yip smiled as Records evolved around him, the many winding paths of the story clear to him, and he was certain of one thing.</p>
<p class="class_s9">Ell’Hakan would be the key to Yip’s victory.</p>
<p class="class_s9">And Jake Thayne, the Viper’s downfall.</p>
