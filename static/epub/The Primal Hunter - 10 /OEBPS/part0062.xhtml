<p class="class_s8h3"><span class="class_s8h1">J</span>ake stepped through the gateway to the forty-first floor, instantly feeling the sunlight upon his skin and the light breeze of the wind. Immediately, he knew he had come to a massive space, which honestly felt damn refreshing after Minaga’s Labyrinth.</p>
<p class="class_s8h2">He opened his eyes to find greenish soil beneath his feet. They were standing on a vast, desolate plain of nothing but barren ground. The soil felt dead and bereft of energy, and looking around, Jake noted they were atop a small hill with a very slight incline, giving them a good look at their surroundings.</p>
<p class="class_s8h2">“A planet of some sort,” the Sword Saint noted.</p>
<p class="class_s8h2">“Ree!” Sylphie added, saying that the amount of wind indicated it was a larger planet.</p>
<p class="class_s8h2">Jake still remembered the planet they had been on during the very first floor, though he was unsure if that had been a real planet or just a big meteor or something. Planets after the system all seemed so damn big, though Jake had to admit he hadn’t seen that many, and using Primordial-4 as any kind of frame of reference seemed like a horrible idea.</p>
<p id="page_591" class="class_s8h2">He also recalled the message about these floors all being a lot bigger. As Jake was having these thoughts, the notification welcoming them to the floor appeared.</p>
<p class="class_s8t1">Welcome to the forty-first floor of Nevermore: Tri-World</p>
<p class="class_s8t1">You have arrived on Tri-World, a planet occupied by three major factions vying for control. First is the Beastfolk Alliance, a faction consisting of beastfolk and beasts alike that have united after finding themselves suppressed by the two other factions for years.</p>
<p class="class_s8t1">Second is the Enlightened Republic, the most powerful faction of the three. Elves, humans, and dwarves used to be in conflict, but many years ago formed a republic to battle the two other factions, thus becoming the most powerful.</p>
<p class="class_s8t1">Finally, the Risen Kingdom is an offshoot of undead who have long since lost contact with the true Risen Empire, yet they still retain much of the heritage from their faction. Despite being the smallest faction in both population and area controlled, they are considered second only to the Enlightened Republic.</p>
<p class="class_s8t1">These three factions have been at odds for millennia with no signs of stopping. As new arrivals on this world, you belong to no faction. Your actions from here on out shall be entirely up to you, as you can explore and find all there is to Tri-<span id="page_592"></span>World… including the deep secrets of this planet. In this quest, you have only one objective:</p>
<p class="class_s8t1">Determine the fate of Tri-World.</p>
<p class="class_s8x1">Main objective: Determine the fate of Tri-World.</p>
<p class="class_s8x1">Bonus objectives: N/A</p>
<p class="class_s8x1">Current progress: Fate Determined (0/1)</p>
<p class="class_s8x1">Note: More events, achievements, or objectives may be hidden on the floor.</p>
<p class="class_s14">Current Nevermore Points: 54,373</p>
<p class="class_s8h2">They all rapidly read it over, and Jake was left with a feeling of uncertainty.</p>
<p class="class_s8h2">“What exactly are we supposed to do?” he questioned out loud, half to himself and half to the others.</p>
<p class="class_s8h2">“It does strike me as very open-ended,” the Sword Saint said, nodding.</p>
<p class="class_s8h2">“Grandpa did mention that trials like this exist in some dungeons, so it being present in Nevermore isn’t too odd…” Dina nodded, seemingly deep in thought. “In these instances, there usually isn’t a wrong or a right thing to do, as long as you finish whatever objective the dungeon gives, and I heard from Grandpa that many just use dungeons like these to experiment in. However, seeing as it is Nevermore and we earn Nevermore Points… I am not sure. I would guess some things would give more points than others.”</p>
<p class="class_s8h2"><span class="class_s13">“Three factions, all competing in a large world,”</span> the Fallen King said.<span class="class_s13"> “I tentatively see a few approaches, but none of them are feasible before we know more. In any case, I would assume the most basic solution would be to assist one faction in completely taking over the planet, with another being to wipe <span id="page_593"></span>out every faction. All it says is that we must determine the fate of the world, not that the fate has to be good.”</span></p>
<p class="class_s8h2">“Those do seem like the most obvious scenarios we can choose,” the Sword Saint concurred.</p>
<p class="class_s8h2">“There… is one more,” Dina said. “We are on a planet, right?”</p>
<p class="class_s8h2">She asked that last part to Jake, who gave his surroundings a good look. “Definitely seems like there is some curvature to the place, yep. The place is quite a bit smaller than Earth, but still pretty big.”</p>
<p class="class_s8h2">“I don’t know how big Earth is, but all planets have one thing in common: their core,” Dina said.</p>
<p class="class_s8h2">Hearing her say this, Jake instantly knew what she was getting at. Villy had mentioned this more than once when they were drinking, every time in relation to planetary sacrificial rituals. “Are you sure we wanna destroy the planet?”</p>
<p class="class_s8h2">Jake knew that rather than destroying a planet’s surface, one could doom a world by going straight for the core, bu⁠—</p>
<p class="class_s8h2">“What?” Dina asked, looking horrified. “No! No, I was thinking we could take control of the Planetary Pylon in the core, if there is one, and then have one faction take control of the planet through that. Why… Why would we just destroy a planet?”</p>
<p class="class_s8h2"><span class="class_s13">“I do believe destroying the planet would qualify as determining its fate,”</span> the Fallen King chimed in.</p>
<p class="class_s8h2">“We are not destroying the planet,” Dina said resolutely, staring daggers at Jake.</p>
<p class="class_s8h2">“You were the one who suggested it first…” Jake muttered.</p>
<p class="class_s8h2">“I didn’t!” Dina protested loudly.</p>
<p class="class_s8h2">“Pretty sure you did,” Jake said, smirking as he looked to the side. “Oh, look, people.”</p>
<p class="class_s8h2">“I am not falling for that,” Dina said, still looking at him with piercing eyes.</p>
<p id="page_594" class="class_s8h2">“No, Jake is right; there are people,” the Sword Saint said as he followed Jake’s gaze.</p>
<p class="class_s8h2">In the distance, a caravan of sorts was moving rapidly towards them. More than a dozen large, wooden barges flew a few meters off the ground, with people standing atop each of them. The one in the front looked bulkier than the others, and from a distance, Jake could Identify the figure at the helm, along with those standing with him.</p>
<p class="class_s8t1">[Caravan Guard Captain – lvl 215]</p>
<p class="class_s14">[Caravan Guard – lvl 204]</p>
<p class="class_s8h2">Jake was somewhat taken aback at the results, as they all looked humanoid yet did not identify as humans. If not human, then at most elves or some other race that closely resembled humans. It wasn’t entirely clear, as they were all hooded or wore armor covering their heads, but they struck Jake as part of the enlightened races for sure. Ultimately, he wrote it off as system fuckery, or more accurately, a subsection of system fuckery known as dungeon fuckery.</p>
<p class="class_s8h2">Their levels were also disappointingly low—as in, way too low for them to be presented as possible opponents.</p>
<p class="class_s8h2">“I would assume that caravan is here to serve as an introduction to the floor in addition to the initial welcome message,” the Sword Saint said.</p>
<p class="class_s8h2"><span class="class_s13">“Very likely,” </span>the Fallen King said. “<span class="class_s13">We should interrogate</span>⁠<span class="class_s13">—”</span></p>
<p class="class_s8h2">“Talk to,” the Sword Saint interrupted.</p>
<p class="class_s8h2"><span class="class_s13">“</span>Talk<span class="class_s13"> to them and learn more about the different factions to decide if any is worth supporting. The fact that the welcome message clarified where each faction is in the power hierarchy makes it obvious that more points will be earned should we <span id="page_595"></span>support a weaker faction. Though, ultimately, I feel that simply supporting one faction or another would be too simple of a solution.”</span></p>
<p class="class_s8h2">Jake had to tentatively agree as the caravan got closer and closer. By now, they had also spotted Jake and company, and had thus decided to slightly change their course to move straight toward them. It was a tad surprising that they didn’t decide to avoid the five strangers with higher levels than anyone in their caravan, but Jake wasn’t their boss.</p>
<p class="class_s8h2">A few moments later, they came within speaking distance, and the Guard Captain at the helm of the caravan yelled out loudly, “Be careful! You shouldn’t just be standing there!”</p>
<p class="class_s8h2"><span class="class_s13">“Is that a threat?”</span> the Fallen King’s voice echoed out in an offended tone. However, the other party didn’t seem affected in the slightest.</p>
<p class="class_s8h2">“No such thing! Some nasty Tunnelers are found in this area, so I just wanted to warn you that standing on the ground can be dangerous. They react to vibrations and such… Wait, how did you even get here? Where is your ship, or did you fly by yourselves?”</p>
<p class="class_s8h2">“Freak-accident teleportation,” Jake responded.</p>
<p class="class_s8h2">“Oh…” the Guard Captain said. “Where from?”</p>
<p class="class_s8h2">Jake briefly shared a glance with the others and, after seeing their unbothered expressions, just answered, “From another universe entirely, we think. Or at least another planet.”</p>
<p class="class_s8h2">“Ah, alright, I got it,” the Guard Captain said as he laughed, the other guards also chuckling along after he made a hand motion. “You should have just said you got isekai’d.”</p>
<p class="class_s8h2">“I… What?” Jake said with an open mouth.</p>
<p class="class_s8h2">“You teleported here from another world, right? Yeah, we call that getting isekai’d around here. Happens quite frequently. Heck, that is why we have so many different races on this planet. I myself was teleported here quite a few years ago.”</p>
<p id="page_596" class="class_s8h2">“What kind of dungeon is this?” Jake questioned out loud.</p>
<p class="class_s8h2">“This planet is a bit peculiar, indeed,” the Guard Captain laughed.</p>
<p class="class_s8h2">“You do know we are in a dungeon, right?” Jake tried to ask, seeing as the guy seemed to have some level of intelligence.</p>
<p class="class_s8h2">“The planet is called Tri-World, though I think that name is still semi-recent, as a few still referred to it as Quad-World when I first got here. The fourth faction was eliminated a century and a half ago.”</p>
<p class="class_s8h2">The man’s answer confirmed something for Jake. <span class="class_s13">“Yep, dungeon fuckery makes them not know they are in a dungeon,”</span> Jake communicated through the Golden Mark.</p>
<p class="class_s8h2"><span class="class_s13">“These Tri-World denizens have come up with an odd word to describe people getting teleported here,” </span>Dina commented.</p>
<p class="class_s8h2"><span class="class_s13">“Yeah… you know what, I am just going to assume that the word I hear is not the same one you do, as that would be very weird,”</span> Jake said, blaming everything on the translation skill.</p>
<p class="class_s8h2"><span class="class_s13">“If it is any comfort, I believe I hear the same word,”</span> the Sword Saint said. <span class="class_s13">“Takes me back to before the system. You know, one of my great-grandchildren was really into that sort of thing…”</span></p>
<p class="class_s8h2"><span class="class_s13">“Let’s please just move on and learn about this damn place to continue,”</span> Jake insisted. He felt like the system was trolling him with the kind of words it used sometimes, but… fuck, it fit this situation, so what the hell could he do?</p>
<p class="class_s8h2">“Where do you folks plan on heading, anyway?” the Guard Captain said. “Seeing as you got two humans with you, the Enlightened Republic seems pertinent, but as you are Otherworlders, you are pretty free to go wherever, though things may get a bit tougher there.”</p>
<p class="class_s8h2">“Enlightened Republic? What is that?” Jake asked, trying to be smart and get information from the guy. He also thought it <span id="page_597"></span>would be weird if they knew about the factions on a planet they had just been teleported t⁠—</p>
<p class="class_s8h2">“System sure screwed up, not even giving you the basic information package, eh? People usually get a notification…” The Guard Captain looked rather confused. “Oh, well. I guess mistakes happen. Hey, kid, do we have an extra map somewhere?”</p>
<p class="class_s8h2">He said the last part to one of the other guards, who promptly saluted him. “Yes, sir!”</p>
<p class="class_s8h2">A few seconds passed before the Guard Captain said in an impatient tone, “Then give it to me?”</p>
<p class="class_s8h2">“Yes, sir!” the guard said as he took out a map and handed it to the Guard Captain, who proceeded to throw it down to Jake and sigh.</p>
<p class="class_s8h2">“This world’s natives are all a bit… odd,” the Guard Captain explained. “They don’t really do much unless prompted and just move through their routines, so it is a safe bet that anyone who approaches you and speaks first with semi-normal conversational skills is an Otherworlder like us. This odd trait of the world’s denizens has its ups and downs, but… overall, you get used to it.”</p>
<p class="class_s8h2">He didn’t sound like he entirely believed the last part himself.</p>
<p class="class_s8h2">“Where are you headed to?” Jake asked.</p>
<p class="class_s8h2">“The Enlightened Republic’s capital, which was also why I proposed going there first, but we will make stops in the other faction’s territories on the way if you five wanna tag along,” the Guard Captain said in an enthusiastic tone.</p>
<p class="class_s8h2">Jake checked with his party and got agreements all around. Seeing as they needed to gather information, sticking with the caravan guy for a while seemed like a good idea. Plus, the floating boat was actually pretty damn fast, making it a non-horrible mode of transportation—especially considering the <span id="page_598"></span>Fallen King, Sword Saint, and Dina were not in absolutely peak condition yet after the Minaga fight.</p>
<p class="class_s8h2">Jake smiled. “Sounds like a fine idea.”</p>
<p class="class_s8h2">“Then welcome aboard!” the guy said, smiling back and laughing. “I am not going to complain about having five people stronger than myself coming along. Man, now I nearly hope we get attacked on the way so I can harvest some materials to sell to the Beastfolk Alliance. Having actual people to talk to isn’t too bad either.”</p>
<p class="class_s8h2">“Can’t even say I would complain if we got into some fun fights, and we are more than interested in learning more about this world,” Jake said, grinning as the boat began to move just after they boarded, making them skirt across the landscape at impressive speeds.</p>
<p class="class_s8h2">The Caravan Guard Captain spoke casually to them all for a while before adopting a serious expression. “I do have one warning, though. Make sure to follow local laws and customs in any territory ruled by a faction. These small villages are rather normal, but when we enter the bigger cities, and especially the capital, things change. The culture here may seem odd and different to you as new arrivals, but the nobles are set in their ways. Be careful—some powerful people are lurking about.”</p>
<p class="class_s8h2">“Oh, what kind of differences are we talking about?” Jake asked curiously.</p>
<p class="class_s8h2">The Guard Captain sighed as he clenched his fists. “You’ll see when we get there.”</p>
<div class="class_s20"><div class="class_s18"><img src="image_rsrc7AN.jpg" alt="" class="class_s19"/></div></div>
<p class="class_s21">Three weeks later…</p>
<p id="page_599" class="class_s8h3">The large tower crumbled behind Jake and fell into the massive pit that had opened up, consuming the streets below. Even now, the remnants of Jake’s destructive arcane mana still ravaged what had once been a city as he stood there, floating in mid-air.</p>
<p class="class_s8h2">Far in the distance, a golden pillar descended, lighting up the landscape from the power unleashed by the Fallen King. Elsewhere, a massive tornado scoured the terrain, leaving a wake of pure destruction that sucked up and shredded entire villages.</p>
<p class="class_s8h2">In another direction, massive rainclouds hung far up in the sky, their drizzles turning the world below into Swiss cheese. Finally, an entire forest had overgrown and seemingly turned against any beings who lived too close or were unfortunate enough to have resided there upon their arrival.</p>
<p class="class_s8h2">Jake looked at the destruction with a steely look, not even bothering to scan the thousands upon thousands of notifications his actions had brought him.</p>
<p class="class_s8h2"><span class="class_s13">“So, everyone’s in agreement?”</span> Jake asked through the Golden Mark.</p>
<p class="class_s8h2"><span class="class_s13">“Yes… this seems like the only way to stop this… this… place,”</span> Dina said in an angry tone.</p>
<p class="class_s8h2"><span class="class_s13">“And if your idea doesn’t work?”</span> Jake asked.</p>
<p class="class_s8h2"><span class="class_s13">“Then perhaps getting rid of the planet altogether is for the best,”</span> Dina answered, not a shred of mercy in her voice.</p>
