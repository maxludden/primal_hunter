An ancient power. A chance to be a Hero. </span>Danny Kendrick was a down-on-his luck performer who always struggled to find his place. He certainly never wanted to be a hero. He just hoped to earn a living doing what he loved. That all changes when he pisses off the wrong guy and gets transported to another world. Stuck in a fantasy realm straight out of a Renaissance Fair, Danny quickly discovers that there's more to life. Like magic, axe-wielding brutes, super hot elf assassins, and a talking screen that won't leave him alone. He'll need to adapt fast, turn on the charm, and get stronger if he hopes to survive this dangerous new world. But he has a knack for trouble. Gifted what seems like an innocent ancient lute after making a questionable deal with a Hag, Danny becomes the target of mysterious factions who seek to claim its power. It's up to him, Screenie, and his new barbaric friend, Curr, to uncover the truth and become the heroes nobody knew they needed. And maybe, just maybe, Danny will finally find a place where he belongs. <span class="class_s15">Don't miss the start of this isekai LitRPG Adventure filled with epic fantasy action, unforgettable characters, loveable companions, unlikely heroes, a detailed System, power progression, and plenty of laughs. </span>From the minds <span id="page_845"></span>of USA Today bestselling and Award-winning duo Rhett C Bruno &amp; Jaime Castle, <span class="class_s7a">An Expected Hero </span>is perfect for fans of <span class="class_s7a">Dungeon Crawler Carl, Kings of the Wyld, </span>and <span class="class_s7a">This Trilogy is Broken!</span> </p></div>
