      <p class="first1"><span class="first-letter">T</span>he gap between grades only grew larger and more challenging to overcome the higher one went. For a decently talented E-grade to beat a weak, low-tier D-grade was only to be expected, while the same could not be said for a D-grade killing a C-grade.</p>
      <p class="subsq">This did not mean it wasn’t possible or even considered relatively uncommon among those classified as geniuses. In fact, Jake had a high level of confidence he would be able to kill plenty of C-grade before he eventually reached the tier himself. But even with this confidence, he was still not sure if being level 150—only halfway to C-grade—was quite good enough.</p>
      <p class="subsq">However, some things did give him a chance. What Jake was walking into was the area of a C-grade Isoptera Queen variant, based on his own estimates. He did not hold doubt in his mind it would be significantly stronger than the late D-grades before, but that honestly mattered less than it should.</p>
      <p class="subsq">If the C-grade Queen acted in the same vein as the D-grades, there were many things to exploit. The fumigation stratagem would likely still prove effective, and even if it didn’t, the Queen was a healer with little to no offensive capabilities.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Jake did not think it would be a short fight either way, but he had high confidence in waiting out even a C-grade’s mana pool if he could force it to waste mana on trying to protect hordes of eggs for an extended period of time.</p>
      <p class="subsq">He also assumed there would be more Guards, but it should be possible to maybe kite them out of the biodome or also use them to consume the mana of the Queen. One thing was certain, though: it was going to be a marathon, and Jake would try to hold back on using any boosting skills unless absolutely necessary.</p>
      <p class="subsq">The thought of getting some melee-weapon practice in did occur to him, but he ultimately decided not to, as it would be too risky.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Before entering the next biodome, Jake prepared everything. He poisoned stable arrows with his best Necrotic Poison and even had some with hemotoxin on them in case that proved more effective, as well as a third bunch with Blood of the Malefic Viper.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Without seeing his target, he could not make an Arrow of the Ambitious Hunter, so he would have to go in without that.</p>
      <p class="subsq">As a final act of preparation, he did something he rarely even considered: planned a path of escape.</p>
      <p class="subsq">He had located narrow tunnels the large Guards could not fit through, and with some Alchemical Flame and arcane beams, he made them longer to allow him to connect to tunnels further above, effectively giving him shortcuts through the maze that was the termite hive.</p>
      <p class="subsq">With everything ready, Jake made his way over to the sealed-off entrance to the biodome. He assumed these termites simply dug their way through and sealed it back up whenever they needed to leave, which was probably rarely. They did not have to eat, so all they needed to do was bring in natural treasures and open the hatchery up when a new generation was born.</p>
      <p class="subsq">He burned his path through the nearly ten-meter-long wall of soil, dirt, and stone, breaking the final enchanted barrier to enter the biodome. The moment he did so, the mana washed over him, and his senses spread out all over the biodome. This one was far larger than any he had seen before, spanning perhaps fifteen kilometers in diameter and with more than a kilometer to the ceiling.</p>
      <p class="subsq">There were no eggs right around where he had entered, but he felt them further in as he saw movement. A massive figure mulled across the ground, looking like a moving warehouse. The huge thorax of the termite swayed and expelled some magical mist onto a cluster of eggs, and Jake instantly used his Identify.</p>

      <p class="subsq">It was a true-blue C-grade monster—the leader of the termite hive and likely the mother of all the other Queens Jake had seen so far.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Jake scouted the room, as he felt its defenders too. Ten figures rose from the soil not far from the Hive Queen, all of them familiar and confirming one of Jake’s predictions.</p>

      <p class="first2">They were all towards the peak of D-grade, but there were no C-grade Guards. Jake had hoped and assumed the Hive Queen was only early C-grade at best, probably between 200 and 210, so it was likely it would not have been able to make any C-grade Guards yet.</p>
      <p class="subsq">But… he knew not to underestimate the ten Guards. He had beaten five at once two times, but these were stronger than any of the others had been, and their supporting Queen was far more powerful than anything Jake had ever fought.</p>
      <p class="subsq">With a motion, he made a small barrier of soil at the hole he had just entered from, making a mental note of where it was in case he needed to flee. Focusing on one of the Guards, he began summoning an Arrow of the Ambitious Hunter within his quiver.</p>
      <p class="subsq">From the beginning, the Queen had been aware of his presence but hadn’t moved. Whether it was aware Jake had slain three other Queens was questionable, as the termites so far had only shown surface-level intelligence, with none of the non-Queen ones displaying any signs of having actual egos. They were nothing more than biological cogs in a machine.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Jake prepared his starting attack by cutting his own arm and willing for the blood to seep out, forming globes in the air. He then condensed arcane mana around the blood. Simultaneously, he took out his bow and began charging Arcane Powershot.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Displaying clear acts of aggression, the termites finally moved. Five Guards charged Jake while the rest stayed defensively around the Queen. The arcane bolts with blood were fired at an upwards angle, not targeting any termite, while he released the Arcane Powershot straight for the Guard at the front.</p>
      <p class="subsq">The arcane bolts he’d summoned were of the stable variety, with only a sliver of destructive energy, so when he triggered them, the resulting explosion was just them shattering, sending bloody shards of arcane energy flying everywhere. This was a tactic he had used against prior biodomes to great success, and this time, too, it made the Hive Queen instantly react, summoning barriers around all the affected eggs.</p>
      <p class="subsq">His Arcane Powershot was also blocked by a golden barrier, and the Guards kept charging, unbothered. Jake fired a few more salvos, only to have them all blocked, before he was forced to dodge away. Unfurling the wings on his back, Jake flew away and spread poison in his wake.</p>
      <p class="subsq">They chased him with great speed, but Jake just kept fleeing, not even having time to land potshots. He had been prepared for the Queen to summon barriers to cut him off, but no such thing happened. Jake just kept flying as the poison mist permeated the room. Jake made it worse by spraying a bit of his blood here and there.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Arcane bolts were also still being flung out, but none had done any damage to anything so far. The Hive Queen protected everything from his attacks, no matter how minor, and as the poison mist began spreading everywhere, that became a lot of surface area to keep protected.</p>
      <p class="subsq">To begin with, Jake had been chased by only five Guards, but soon another three joined them. He was lucky in that they had no real strategy to their movements. They just chased him directly, meaning that as long as he was faster, he would avoid getting pincer-moved.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Jake was not truly fighting the C-grade, just trying to tire it out. He tried a few times to damage a Guard, but it was honestly a waste of time. Barriers would pop up instantly, and Jake would waste his time. Due to this, he focused on attacking the eggs and sometimes even the Queen herself with cost-efficient attacks.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Flying somewhat lower and closer to some eggs, Jake took out Eternal Hunger and changed the shape to be similar to a rake. He swung it down towards some eggs and met a barrier as he kept flying, raking across the golden shield, sending up sparks of energy. However, more importantly, he absorbed energy.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Smiling, Jake was confident for now. He would not change things up too fast, and he even purposefully allowed the Guards to get close on many occasions, even making one scratch him with its mandibles. It was all in an attempt to avoid the Hive Queen deciding it needed to finish him off faster. He wanted it to think it was a moment away from victory at all times, and doing more would be a waste of energy.</p>
      <p class="subsq">He was more or less hoping the Hive Queen would fall into the sunk-cost fallacy and not throw away the mana it had already spent by sacrificing a few Guards or eggs to take him down.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Jake even made some "desperate" attacks towards the Hive Queen to really sell it, all of them utterly useless. After around fifteen minutes of this, Jake noticed that his mana pool had barely depleted. He smiled.</p>
      <p class="subsq">The environment and high mana density to feed the Queen mixing with the poison mist made the environment absolutely optimal for Jake. Coupled with the increased mana regeneration from the mask and his already-high pool, he could hold off on a mana potion, maybe even consuming a stamina potion instead.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Time kept passing, and Jake just kept training his ability to dodge. The Queen had begun doing some different things, including something that slightly empowered the Guards, which had resulted in Jake finding less time to do damage, just prolonging the "fight" even more.</p>
      <p class="subsq">It was now a competition of resources. The Queen was far more powerful than anything else, but it did not have any true offensive abilities, as far as Jake could tell. Considering this was his first encounter with a C-grade, he was honestly ambivalent about it.</p>
      <p class="subsq">But… this was a different kind of challenge, and he would take it. As it was currently going, Jake had no idea when the fight would end, but considering he felt like he could do this for a week straight, and since he was sure the Guards expended more stamina than he did, that would never become relevant. Jake barely had to think when dodging the uninspired blows of the Guards, as he just kept flying, kiting, firing out arcane bolts and orbs while occasionally striking barriers with Eternal Hunger to drain a bit of energy.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Jake was not delusional enough to think this would keep going until the Queen ran out of mana, and he didn’t need it to either. He still had many tools in his arsenal to pull out. So as long as he could keep it going for a good while, the Queen should have wasted enough resources for him to win even if she got serious.</p>
      <p class="subsq">All ten Guards were now chasing Jake as he kept up the act. He looked at the Queen and got an odd feeling. Normally he could get some kind of read on an opponent. Anger, annoyance, impatience… at least something.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Yet all he felt from the Queen was apathy, like his presence was barely of any consequence. He was confused… until he felt something. Movement below…</p>
      <p class="subsq"><i class="calibre4">Fast…</i></p>
      <p class="subsq">Something was com—</p>
      <p class="subsq">Suddenly it entered his sphere, and Jake barely had time to use One Step Mile, as where he had just stood erupted in an explosion of dust and soil. Jake’s instincts went on full overdrive as his danger sense exploded, and without any hesitation, he covered his body in scales. Arcane Awakening jumped to 60% right off the bat.</p>
      <p class="subsq">As he looked up the ceiling of the hatchery, he saw a figure: a sleek termite, smaller than even Jake when on all six legs. Its legs looked like black spears of metal, its body covered in a dark, reflective carapace. There were two menacing mandibles at its mouth, but the two black compound eyes on its head were more disturbing.</p>
      <p class="subsq">That was when Jake remembered something he had once learned from his grandfather. A little factoid he had completely forgotten until today:</p>
      <p class="subsq">Termite hives had kings.</p>
      <div class="alignment-block">
        <div class="element">
        <p class="alignment-block-content3"><b class="calibre1">[Isoptera Hive King – lvl ???]</b></p>
      </div>
      </div>
      <p class="subsq">And this one was <i class="calibre4">not</i> made for breeding.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Every cell in Jake’s body screamed, and for once, he listened and did the only wise thing: he ran.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Or, he tried to run.</p>
      <p class="subsq">His danger sense exploded again, and he didn’t even have time to step down before the Hive King leaped at him. Like a bullet, it reached him instantly. Jake held up Eternal Hunger to block and instinctually stabbed down with the Bloodfeast Dagger. He felt the impact on his arm as he hit the carapace of the insect, and it felt like he had just hit metal. The impact from the blow of the Hive King came at the same time, and it wasn’t as bad as expect—</p>
      <p class="subsq">With a swift motion away from Jake’s blade, the termite bit down again before he could react. His chest exploded, sending scales and blood flying everywhere.</p>
      <p class="subsq"><i class="calibre4">Wha</i>—</p>
      <p class="subsq">A deep cut had been left from his shoulder to his groin, tearing through everything. The mandibles of the termite moved again, but Jake managed to step down and teleport away, his mind yet to fully register what had happened. He fled straight for the tunnel he had entered through as the ten Guards also arrived.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Jake did not have time to think; he pushed Pride to its fullest in the form of a mental attack on the Guards, simultaneously using Gaze on all ten of them. Blood spilled out of his eyes as they all froze. Jake’s danger sense reacted again when the Hive King moved, and Jake managed to step down again and teleport.</p>
      <p class="subsq">The moment he appeared, he tried to sway, but a black termite leg penetrated his chest and pinned him to the ground. Before the mandibles tore his head off, Jake sent arcane mana exploding out of one hand. He managed to blow himself to the side, ripping out his own flesh as a deep hole was torn in the ground with the termite’s mandibles.</p>
      <p class="subsq">He gripped the ground and pulled as he launched himself forward with another arcane explosion. Another black leg came down and penetrated his thigh, but he kept his momentum despite his entire leg being shredded.</p>
      <p class="subsq">While in the air, he turned and saw the Hive King nearly upon him, the mandibles only a few meters from his face. Jake used Gaze of the Apex Hunter again, freezing the Hive King for a fraction of a moment. Jake’s eyes popped, and his vision turned black. He nearly lost consciousness from the strain of using the skill.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Yet he kept moving, finally entering the tunnel that he had entered through. His one leg was just shredded meat, and his entire body was bloody and broken, but his wings had managed to stay intact. Jake landed on the ground to teleport one more time.</p>
      <p class="subsq">He went straight for one of the emergency tunnels he had made before. Just before he reached it, his danger sense alerted him just in time, and he flapped a wing to dodge. It moved him slightly to the side as a black, termite-shaped bullet passed him, tearing off his left arm and wing in the process.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Jake slammed his one remaining leg down in an explosion of arcane mana, and with his one remaining arm, he channeled pure destructive arcane energy in front of him to make sure he would create a path.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Jake flew upwards like a rocket as the Hive King followed again. It simply tore through the ground towards him, but at least it was slowed somewhat, allowing Jake to dodge out of the way just as he entered another large tunnel.</p>
      <p class="subsq"><i class="calibre4">I need to thi</i>—</p>
      <p class="subsq">The termite attacked again, and Jake pre-emptively dodged the charge but still had the wound on his left side worsened. Jake tried to find a solution, and an idea struck him. Mana began moving around him again, but it was not of the arcane variant this time. Black mana began condensing with the help of Pride as the Hive King charged again.</p>
      <p class="subsq">He did not move, and it reached him in a flash… Then time slowed down.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Moment of the Primal Hunter activated, and Jake blew up the dark mana all around him to mask what he planned to do. At the same time, he swayed and dodged the charging termite, making it fly past him. Above him was the next emergency tunnel, while the tunnel the termite had just come through was below.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Jake dropped down in the hole as a bow appeared in his remaining hand. He positioned it so he could hold it with his one leg as a large, white arrow appeared—Arrow of the Ambitious Hunter.</p>
      <p class="subsq">However, he did not fire it towards the termite, but instead straight up through his next escape tunnel. He dropped down into the hole just as time returned to normal and Arcane Awakening was disabled. He stored his bow as the arrow flew upwards, and Jake covered himself with his half-broken cloak and willed it to camouflage him, hiding everything he had just done within a bubble of dark mana.</p>
      <p class="subsq">He fell into a small crevice in the tunnel and hid, focusing on his Stealth skill as much as possible. He dispelled all signs of magic, and he felt incredibly weak all over as he huddled up.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Above him, he felt the Hive King through the Mark he had instinctively placed on it, learning that it had chased the Arrow of the Ambitious Hunter up through the escape tunnel. Jake held his breath and focused on making his presence as invisible as possible.</p>
      <p class="subsq">He felt the termite move around above as it inspected the area. It stood still for a moment before it turned back. Jake felt it move slightly upwards, and then it leaped again.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Jake nearly had a heart attack as the Hive King tore through the soil less than ten meters to his side, digging downwards again towards the hatchery. Luckily, he managed to keep his focus as he hid away, not even daring to take out a health potion in fear it would reveal him.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Needless to say… Jake’s first encounter with a C-grade had not gone as expected.</p>
