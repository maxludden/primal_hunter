      <p class="first1"><span class="first-letter">M</span>eira sat and stared at the pile of papers within the western residence as she had been ordered. However, she was utterly lost as to what was expected of her. The assignment simply didn’t make any sense. She had done as asked the first time around already, but that was clearly unacceptable.</p>
      <p class="subsq">The problem was that she couldn’t figure out what would be acceptable. She began shaking a bit at the thought. She hadn’t even served her new master for a few days, and she was already disappointing him and failing tasks. Perhaps she simply wasn’t good enough to comprehend what he asked of her? Was there some profound reason or deep meaning behind the task he wanted her to see?</p>
      <p class="subsq">There was only one thing she felt relatively sure of: this was a test. It had to be. Was it a way to scout out her thought process and evaluate if she was suited to serve? Maybe it was just as simple as him wanting the insights of a nobody like her because he valued perspectives wildly different from his own?</p>
      <p class="subsq">She recalled the final thing he had said about viewing this as choosing a path for a sibling of hers. She had two sisters and five brothers, but her brothers were already set in their paths as builders and miners, while her two sisters had naturally been trained to be married off or sworn to another faction or influential family.</p>
      <p class="subsq">But, what if she had to pick lessons for them? They didn’t know anything about alchemy, but would it do them good to learn? Were they even talented enough to learn it? Her one sister was pretty good at mana control and a promising mage, so maybe?</p>
      <p class="subsq">Meira began looking at the lessons again. Her sister was still free, and if she learned some useful things, she would be able to increase her value. Maybe even enough to be viewed as more than just someone to be married off. Skilled alchemists were valued nearly anywhere and by any faction, so that would be a good path. If she was talented in it.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Turning her gaze to the pages, she picked up one of the lessons she had selected before about finding the path suitable for yourself. If she had to pick for her sister, brother, or even herself… this had to be one of them, right? She was certain it would be good for anyone starting out on any new path to truly learn what they were good at.</p>
      <p class="subsq">The problem was… wouldn’t the other lessons be based on the person’s discovery of their own talents?</p>
      <p class="subsq">She thought again and remembered she had to answer why it was interesting. Meira thought about it and decided to write her reasoning on a separate piece of paper. As she prepared to write, a wild thought entered her head… Wouldn’t it be interesting if her sister was talented enough to not just learn alchemy, but even become a member of a faction? Maybe even the Order of the Malefic Viper?</p>
      <p class="subsq">That would mean she could uplift not only herself, but also everyone else. If she was good enough, she could even buy or acquire their father, who had also been turned into a slave… maybe have some influence over the clan back home?</p>
      <p class="subsq"><i class="calibre4">Don’t be stupid,</i> she reminded herself as she slapped her own chin a few times, enough to draw blood. She wiped it off quickly, sighed, and wrote down that it would be interesting because it would allow someone to be more useful and have a better future. It was far more realistic that her sister could become a valued servant or find work somewhere if she was a talented alchemist. Not by the Order of the Malefic Viper’s standards, but just for a small place like their village.</p>
      <p class="subsq">With this mindset, she tried to put together a proper list. She had been given three days, and she was certain it could not be this simple. Clearly, judging by how much time she’d been given, there was a deeper reason she had to realize.</p>

      <p class="first2">Jake felt damn good finally having some alone time. No one bothered him for over a day as he just relaxed, ate toxic materials, chilled with books, and overall had a swell of a time. The mansion itself was filled to the brim with different things to explore, including some board games that reminded Jake of chess, and even a damn television of sorts. A 3D television one could buy lessons for to enjoy on their own time.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Soon it was time to leave for his second lesson. The first one had been a very low-level one where it was entirely possible Jake had been the strongest one attending. He had no interest in going back for a second one either.</p>
      <p class="subsq">The lesson he was headed to would be on an entirely different level, and Jake was extremely interested in seeing how it would work out. Before he went, he decided to actually change things up to hide his identity in case he somehow met someone who knew of him.</p>
      <p class="subsq">He brought his displayed level all the way down to 100 and shifted the color of his cloak to appear entirely dark green. He also took off his armor, put it in his spatial storage, and shifted to something more casual. Jake was pretty sure that most who attended could easily kill him if they wanted to anyway, no matter what gear he wore.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Changing his level to 100 may seem weird, but the reason he did so was apparent: it made it damn obvious it was changed. It led to some doubt that Jake could be far stronger, likely not even in D-grade, and coupled with his Bloodline and immunity to presences, he had great confidence in faking it.</p>
      <p class="subsq">The clothes he wore were ones he had found in the mansion. It was just a casual shirt and pants that he covered with his cloak. He even went so far as to change his boots. As for the mask, Jake thought a while, trying to mentally change it, and to his surprise, it responded. Jake could slightly warp how it looked and even change the color just with mental commands. Perhaps it was part of that Living Wood enchantment?</p>
      <p class="subsq">With everything ready, Jake stepped through the gate to his second lesson.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Instantly, he felt the wind upon his face, as his environment had changed completely. Jake found himself standing not in a lecture hall, but atop a large, flattened mountain with shaped stone pavilions on pillars surrounding a massive, lowered central stage.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Jake saw different creatures already lounging on the different pavilions all around him. On one was a raging inferno that sometimes took on a humanoid form, and on another, a large wyvern. Others nearby even had goddamn dragons on them.</p>
      <p class="subsq">In fact, Jake felt like the majority of those in attendance were dragons, and looking about confirmed this feeling. Down on the center stage sat a single being in meditation. It looked like an elf or a human except for the slightly twisted horns coming out of his forehead. There were no scales covering his body at all, which surprised Jake quite a bit.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Villy had scales at all times and did not look at all like this dragon in human form. Jake wondered why that was but decided to just chalk it up to gods probably being able to customize their form more. Or maybe it was that the humanoid form was just highly customizable to begin with?</p>
      <p class="subsq">When Jake appeared on his own pavilion, he got a few glances his way from surrounding platforms. A few dragons and wyverns, a human, and some other scalekin were among them. They plainly wanted to probe the apparent D-grade that had appeared.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Jake just ignored them. He did feel a slight tinge of presence worm his way as one of the dragons got curious, and the moment it impacted him, Jake glanced the way of the dragon. He met its eyes and just stared. A second passed before the dragon averted its gaze, with Jake doing the same.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Their exchange had been observed by others, and after it, all probing coming his way dispersed. It was like he had passed some weird test to be allowed to stay there. Not that Jake thought a normal D-grade could manage being surrounded by C-, B-, and A-grades all around. He had no idea how to actually determine the grades of others present, though he knew true dragons had to be at least B-grade.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Nothing more interesting happened before it was time for the lesson to begin. The dragon teacher sitting down on the platform opened his eyes and slowly stood up.</p>
      <p class="subsq">"Welcome."</p>
      <p class="subsq">His voice echoed throughout the entire mountain, and Jake felt the inherent power in it. Not a shadow of a doubt was in his mind that the A-grade below could erase him from existence with a mere thought. It was almost exciting.</p>
      <p class="subsq">"Creation and destruction—fundamental forces and concepts we all inadvertently touch upon on our paths to power, even more so for any alchemist. The Alchemical Flame is a fundamental force in itself, the basic version a marvel at the concept of destruction. It can destroy objects far too powerful for the user to otherwise break. Melt a slab of metal even one’s own Dragonsbreath cannot leave a mark upon. It ignores anti-magical properties and can heat a dragon scale as easily as a piece of coal. However, contrary to what one would believe based on this, the Alchemical Flame is not only a force of destruction, but also a catalyst of creation.</p>
      <p class="subsq">"The purpose of this lesson today is to improve not only the aspect of creation and destruction, but the very nature and connection one has to their flame. The Alchemical Flame is something each of us has wielded on our path as alchemists. A loyal companion that has been at our sides since we began walking this path. Such prolonged use leads to familiarity and understanding at a level beyond regular comprehension."</p>
      <p class="subsq">Jake listened, readily following along with the first part. The second part was also something he understood, even if it clearly led with an assumption of having done alchemy for a long time.</p>
      <p class="subsq">"Like the breath of a dragon, this flame is an integral part of us. It is borne from the depths of one’s soul. At first, this flame is merely another skill and a tool, but as with all other things, it changes the more one uses it. In many ways, the flame becomes an expression of your identity as an alchemist. Perhaps it may not look like that, but the influence is there.</p>
      <p class="subsq">"Willpower impacts the usage of all skills. Due to the malleable nature of the Alchemical Flame, the impact of Willpower is even greater; due to the conceptual nature of the Alchemical Flame, Willpower is more impactful. However, the unconscious effects of Willpower will result in changes to your flame outside of your own intention at times. Many attempt to alleviate this by increasing their level of control and focus during crafting sessions, but I would like to propose doing the exact opposite."</p>
      <p class="subsq">There was almost a shift on the mountaintop, as though what the A-grade had just said was very revolutionary, or perhaps just went against what many presently did. Jake, of course, was mostly clueless about what the guy was on about, even if he did know Willpower impacted all kinds of magic and energy control.</p>
      <p class="subsq">"If your Alchemical Flame becomes so ingrained within you to synchronize directly with your will, a new path opens. I hold this lesson because I recently experienced enlightenment in my struggles to improve my flame. I did not believe it possible, but one day, while I worked with my flame, it appeared to almost oscillate in tandem with my will. It began moving without input, controlled not by my mana, but by my will alone.</p>
      <p class="subsq">"The level of control reached higher levels than ever before, and for a brief moment, I felt like I had grasped the cradle of creation and the vessel of destruction incarnate within my palm. It faded as the flame ran out of mana, but the enlightenment remained. Allow me to demonstrate."</p>
      <p class="subsq">Instantly, the entire center stage was bathed in deep red flames. It swayed in odd patterns as the dragon stood in the middle. He opened the palm of his hand, and the flames gathered and took the form of a statue depicting a dragon.</p>
      <p class="subsq">"First comes creation," the teacher said as the flames parted and spread out, revealing the dragon statue. However, it was not made of flames, but instead what looked like marble. "Entirely a production of the concept of creation born from the flame."</p>
      <p class="subsq">Jake stared, confused… Had the teacher just made something from nothing using the Alchemical Flame?</p>
      <p class="subsq">"This statue is as real as anything else, created only from Willpower and my Alchemical Flame. Of course, creation as a concept is nothing difficult with sufficient power. However, my method varies from such crude methods. Usually, the expenditure of such a task would be significant, but with the Alchemical Flame, I can tap into the system-created concepts embedded within to make use of the innate properties of creation in the Alchemical Flame.</p>
      <p class="subsq">"The same is true for destruction."</p>
      <p class="subsq">The flame swept over his hand, and the statue disappeared. It continued on behind him, where it swept over a mountain range in the distance that also seemed to simply disappear the moment it made contact with the flame.</p>
      <p class="subsq">"Once more, it is all application of Willpower to amplify innate conceptual properties of destruction. However, as I said before, all of this was brought forth from achieving true resonance between your Willpower and your Alchemical Flame. This is where the importance of the Soulspace enters. Do note that the ability to access and actively influence your own Soulspace through conscious thought is a requirement for the following to be done. If you have not already reached the stage of condensing a Soulshape Avatar or something similar, that is something you should begin work on as soon as possible either way."</p>
      <p class="subsq">Jake felt like a few in attendance were disappointed, but Jake didn’t really get it. He knew his Serene Soul Meditation was him entering his Soulspace, and he could enter it anyway if he wanted. Maybe giant lizards were just lazy with that kind of thing?</p>
      <p class="subsq">Then again, it was possible Jake had kind of cheesed being able to enter his Soulshape. He had gone there during the Trial of Myriad Poisons, and he knew why. It was all the influence of Jake’s Bloodline that seemed to effectively simplify things for him to understand them better. That was why what, back then, was essentially a fight of Records had transformed into Jake fighting another version of himself.</p>
      <p class="subsq">The same concept applied with the sky of stars he had made to represent Shroud of the Primordial. The entire Soulspace was like a conceptual place where Jake’s understanding was given a metaphorical form. So, surprisingly enough, he wasn’t completely lost during the lesson so far.</p>
      <p class="subsq">"However, there is one more crucial step. As most of you have no doubt noticed, my Alchemical Flame is not pure. It is instead my Soulflame that I integrated long ago, created from an ember granted to me by an elder from my Dragonflight. But fret not, for even without a Soulflame, there are methods to mimic one. Just be aware you will never achieve full oscillation before you get a Soulflame of your own. "</p>
      <p class="subsq">By now, Jake was really kicking himself for having not actually looked up what the hell a Soulflame was and how to get one.</p>
