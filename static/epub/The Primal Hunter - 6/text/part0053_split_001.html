      <p class="first1"><span class="first-letter">J</span>ake, Reika and the others stepped onto the teleportation circle pointed out by the demon, and were then transported once more. He hadn’t even gotten the name of the horned guy, but he assumed they would probably meet again sometime in the future if he was in charge of the teleportation place.</p>
      <p class="subsq">When he and the others arrived at the other side of the teleportation circle, they found themselves in a new hub of sorts. They walked a bit forward, then stopped and looked around.</p>
      <p class="subsq">"Move," someone said as Jake and the others just stood there.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Jake looked up and saw a large figure around four meters tall with an incredibly bulky build. Jake used Identify as he stepped to the side, the others hurrying after him.</p>
      <div class="alignment-block">
        <div class="element">
        <p class="alignment-block-content3"><b class="calibre1">[Ogre – lvl 178]</b></p>
      </div>
      </div>
      <p class="subsq">The ogre grunted and went on the circle they had just gotten off of. Jake didn’t like the attitude of the ogre but didn’t wanna start shit five seconds after arriving. Instead, he hurried the group forward, where someone walked up to them.</p>
      <p class="subsq">"New arrivals of the 93<sup class="calibre5">rd</sup> Universe for the Academy?" the person said, and Jake confirmed it was yet another demon.</p>
      <div class="alignment-block">
        <div class="element">
        <p class="alignment-block-content3"><b class="calibre1">[Demon – lvl 192]</b></p>
      </div>
      </div>
      <p class="subsq">It was a woman with red skin and glowing orange eyes. She was wearing close to nothing, but had at least covered the essential parts. She had two wings on her back and a tail as well as two small horns, with her proportions on the plentiful side, and Jake instantly knew…</p>
      <p class="subsq"><i class="calibre4">It’s a gosh-darn succubus!</i></p>
      <p class="subsq">The group behind him looked a bit uncomfortable, but Jake just answered, "That’s right, we just arrived."</p>
      <p class="subsq">"Great! Please follow me. You are the second-to-last group we expect today. Oh, and be advised that no violence is allowed within the meeting room, and it will be met with swift execution.” She flashed a bright smile as she led them towards a wall with a magic circle on it.</p>
      <p class="subsq">She took out a token that flashed with light, and the magic circle was replaced with a magical rectangular gate leading into what looked like a large leisure room. "Just through here."</p>
      <p class="subsq">Jake took the lead as he gave her a nod and thanked her in passing, Reika and the eight other alchemists following behind closely. He noticed Reika and the others looking around with expressions of fear, interest, and curiosity, but most of all carefulness. Jake himself had also been rather curious, as he saw many interesting creatures, but maybe he was a bit more used to it than other humans?</p>
      <p class="subsq">Going through the gate in front of them, Jake instantly felt the warmth hit him, as the interior was quite cozy. It was a large space, and Jake saw it already contained around two hundred people. All eyes landed on Jake and his group when they entered, at first with little interest, but in tandem with Jake feeling the Identifies hitting him, their eyes lingered.</p>
      <p class="subsq">It made sense. Currently, Jake was showing himself to be level 181, which made him instantly stand out. As he inspected them back, the first thing he noticed was just the sheer diversity. He saw all kinds of races, all of them of humanoid build, but their power and appearances varied greatly.</p>
      <p class="subsq">There were several smaller groups, which Jake guessed were groups that had come together. He quickly Identified a bunch of the leaders of the groups and saw their levels.</p>
      <div class="alignment-block">
        <div class="element">
        <p class="alignment-block-content3"><b class="calibre1">[Elf – lvl 142]</b></p>
        <p class="alignment-block-content3"><b class="calibre1">[Human – lvl 138]</b></p>
        <p class="alignment-block-content3"><b class="calibre1">[Dwarf – lvl 135]</b></p>
      </div>
      </div>
      <p class="subsq">The levels were relatively high, though lower than Jake’s by a fair deal. Also, one had to remember Jake had really not progressed as much as he probably should in recent times. As a reference, Reika—who walked with him—was comparable to these leaders at level 139.</p>
      <p class="subsq">However, he quickly noticed a discrepancy. The room was split into three parts. One part was with these leaders in it, but further in there were some stairs, with a final, smaller part at the top. Up at the second level, Jake felt the auras of those present and instantly knew that every one of them was powerful. Definitely good enough to give him a good fight.</p>
      <p class="subsq">The first of which was a scaled man—not with usual scales, but fish scales. At his neck, he had gill-like growths. His body was dark blue, and Jake’s Identify made it clear it was quite the exotic race.</p>
      <div class="alignment-block">
        <div class="element">
        <p class="alignment-block-content3"><b class="calibre1">[Gillkin – lvl 165]</b></p>
      </div>
      </div>
      <p class="subsq">Jake had no idea what a gillkin was, but hey, now he knew. The gillkin was one of five leaders of groups in this elevated area, with the next two a bit more human.</p>
      <div class="alignment-block">
        <div class="element">
        <p class="alignment-block-content3"><b class="calibre1">[Human – lvl 159]</b></p>
        <p class="alignment-block-content3"><b class="calibre1">[Elf – lvl 166]</b></p>
      </div>
      </div>
      <p class="subsq">They were a bit more human in that one of them was literally a human, while the other was an elf. Seeing the elf confirmed to Jake that elves were just humans with pointy ears. They were also perhaps a little bit thinner, but nothing really noticeable. Either way, these two were not overly interesting. The human was strong, sure, but compared to someone like the Sword Saint? Eh.</p>
      <p class="subsq">He was probably about the level of Caleb or Carmen, maybe? Probably not even that, if they were equal levels. The next three leaders were more interesting.</p>
      <div class="alignment-block">
        <div class="element">
        <p class="alignment-block-content3"><b class="calibre1">[Risen – lvl 149]</b></p>
      </div>
      </div>
      <p class="subsq">First of all, a Risen. It was a man who looked very human, but Jake felt the man’s aura, and one thing was instantly clear… He’d been blessed by the same god as Casper. <i class="calibre4">Why would someone blessed by the Blightfather be here? Also, how the hell do I know that he is blessed by him?</i></p>
      <p class="subsq">Not questioning it more than necessary, Jake regarded the last one on the second level of the hall.</p>
      <div class="alignment-block">
        <div class="element">
        <p class="alignment-block-content3"><b class="calibre1">[Harpy – lvl 168]</b></p>
      </div>
      </div>
      <p class="subsq">It was a woman with feathers growing on her body and two wing-like arms. So, yeah, a harpy pretty much as described in most fiction. Jake had to admit she did look a little off with a beak for a mouth, and the claws on her hands didn’t look suited to proper alchemy, but what did he know?</p>
      <p class="subsq">These people on the second level had all been interesting in their own right, but the one who stood out the most was the man who stood alone at the highest section of the room: a reptilian figure with black and dark green scales that instantly gave Jake certain flashbacks. He had to admit… he was taken by surprise.</p>
      <div class="alignment-block">
        <div class="element">
        <p class="alignment-block-content3"><b class="calibre1">[Malefic Dragonkin – lvl 185]</b></p>
      </div>
      </div>
      <p class="subsq">Jake stared up at the man, who looked back and met his gaze. For a moment, the world stood still as they sized up each other, and Jake was certain…</p>
      <p class="subsq"><i class="calibre4">Strong…</i></p>
      <p class="subsq">Incredibly strong. The aura he displayed was on another level compared to anyone else present, and moreover, Jake felt something more impressive. A Divine Blessing, given by Villy himself. A cursory glance made it obvious that if anyone in this room was the Chosen of the Malefic Viper, it was the guy in front of him.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Jake couldn’t help but wonder where the hell the guy had come from.</p>
      <p class="subsq"><i class="calibre4">"Villy... who is this guy?"</i> Jake asked.</p>
      <p class="subsq"><i class="calibre4">"Someone who got very close to becoming another Progenitor, and one of my better investments so far. Comes from a pretty small and shitty planet, though, where relative peace has already been established, as the few C-grade beasts reached a stalemate. The guy was originally some weird moleman or something, and I must admit I like the dragonkin look more.”</i> Villy explained all this casually, adding on, <i class="calibre4">"And before you ask the obvious question of how all these people managed to teleport here when I said it was so difficult to you, the reason is that the monument is a two-way teleporter. These people went on a one-way trip and have effectively abandoned their planets for good."</i></p>
      <p class="subsq">Jake listened and acknowledged the Viper’s words as he kept staring at the Dragonkin. The man stared back, and Jake smiled beneath the mask. He teleported across the room with a single step, and another took him up two flights of stairs, where he appeared right in front of the menacing figure at the highest level of the room.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Two auras flared in the room. The Malefic Dragonkin tried to exert his dominance, but Jake just smiled as his legendary Pride of the Malefic Viper activated to boost his own presence. Jake felt the attention of someone who had been observing the room, but he paid it no mind, as he expected it to be some peacekeeper. The attention was not hostile, but more curious at what was happening.</p>
      <p class="subsq">With Pride, Jake was ashamed to admit that his own presence barely matched the other party. He was naturally still unaffected by what the other guy did, and he consciously tried to avoid mixing in anything Bloodline-related, but still. The two of them stood there for a few seconds, both their auras flaring. Then they both calmed down, ending the metaphorical dick-measuring contest.</p>
      <p class="subsq">The dragonkin looked at Jake and smiled. "Draskil."</p>
      <p class="subsq">Jake, assuming it was the guy’s name, answered in kind. "Hunter."</p>
      <p class="subsq">With a small change, of course. Jake had decided to not go with his real name, instead opting for Hunter. Hunter was a real name anyway, so it should be fine, right? Heck, he’d had a kid at his school called Hunter while growing up, so it wasn’t that weird.</p>
      <p class="subsq">The dragonkin just nodded as Jake felt the gazes of everyone present upon them. Jake knew this wasn’t a good strategy if the goal was to stay inconspicuous, but he also knew that was never going to happen. He wasn’t good at acknowledging authority, and with his level displaying him at 181, it didn’t make sense for him not to stand at the highest level either.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Even non-chosen geniuses would be a bit arrogant, right?</p>
      <p class="subsq">He did feel somewhat bad about leaving Reika and the others at the lowest level. She didn’t even try to follow, instead leading the others to stand at a nearby wall.</p>
      <p class="subsq">As he stood there, the dragonkin turned to him. "Challenge Dungeon?"</p>
      <p class="subsq">Jake nodded, surprised. "Yeah."</p>
      <p class="subsq">"Met god?"</p>
      <p class="subsq">Jake nodded again. "Yeah."</p>
      <p class="subsq">"Scary god, but powerful," Draskil said, and by now, Jake was sure of one thing.</p>
      <p class="subsq"><i class="calibre4">"Villy… is this guy… you know?"</i></p>
      <p class="subsq"><i class="calibre4">"Simple? Hell yeah. He was a half-beast-like creature just half a year ago, and the mole people’s language was very simplistic. But don’t misinterpret him as stupid.”</i></p>
      <p class="subsq"><i class="calibre4">"Also, you had more Challenge Dungeons?"</i></p>
      <p class="subsq"><i class="calibre4">"I had a bunch of old ones stashed away that I decided to toss out there after I returned to the multiverse, and the system happily accepted them,” </i>the snake god answered<i class="calibre4">. “It likes to spread powerful legacies to new universes, and mine were pretty scarce</i>.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">Jake mentally acknowledged this as the teleportation gate lit up again, and a crowd of people walked in. It was a mixed group of humans and elves, with the strongest two—a human man and an elf woman—at the front. Both were only around 140, so nothing interesting there.</p>
      <p class="subsq">The succubus from before entered with them. She threw a look around the room, lingering briefly on Jake and Draskil, then regarding the others.</p>
      <p class="subsq">"Alright, with everyone here, let me begin the preliminary instructions. First of all, have one of these.” The succubus waved her hand and sent crystals flying out into the room. "On those, you will see the rules of the Academy and some other practical information. Study it on your own time.</p>
      <p class="subsq">"Before you enter the Academy, there will be a test. This test will take place within a dungeon designed specifically to perform these tests for outsiders, and will give the Order an understanding of you. This trial is performed on an individual basis. You will get a final score from the test that will determine your placement in the academy. Ah, but don’t fret—you can’t fail this test, per se, so even if you perform horrendously and manage to complete the dungeon, you will still be allowed access to the Academy. Note that we only do this as you are natives of a newly integrated universe, so you all have it a bit easier."</p>
      <p class="subsq">Jake nodded along, not sure if he should be surprised at the use of a dungeon to perform the test. Because damn, was that smart. With the dungeon’s ability to have a "save state" of sorts, everyone would enter with the same conditions. It was a bit like the Altmar thing in the dungeon under Haven, actually.</p>
      <p class="subsq">This also made him consider the other ways one could make use of the system. He already knew a lot of architecture was based on spatial expansion, and teleportation seemed quite commonplace. Man, what else was there?</p>
      <p class="subsq">He was starting to get excited about what kind of trial or test the Order could have conjured up.</p>
      <p class="subsq">"Now, please follow me to the location of the dungeon," the guide demon said as she took out the token again. The door they had initially used to enter lit up with runes, and a new gateway opened.</p>
      <p class="subsq">As Jake looked on, he began to have a feeling teleportation circles and gates were more commonplace than actual doors within the Order.</p>

      <p class="first2">An earthquake struck the area, shattering the entire mountain from the pressure. The screams of beasts were a symphony of his making. The large, pathetic worm rose from the ground and squirmed, attempting to hold onto life. A futile attempt, as the power difference was too massive. Nearly as massive as the difference in size between the creature—only slighter larger than a man—and the worm, at over two hundred meters long.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Flesh was crushed as the beast fought back. The world itself became a weapon, pillars of earth rising as if to spear the sky. Yet when they hit the impenetrable shield, they shattered like feeble sand.</p>
      <p class="subsq">The body of the worm hardened as the telekinetic power was interrupted, sending the beast falling to the ground. A worthwhile effort that was ultimately revealed to be futile when his claw turned golden. A flash lit up the environment as the massive beast received five gashing wounds in its side, creating a torrent of blood that made it rain crimson.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Perhaps it was time he stopped playing around. Another ivory claw was raised, and the world was enveloped in gold that soon collected itself into a golden orb crackling with energy. With a simple motion, it was crushed, shooting out a beam. The worm tried to block with a new mountain of rock, but it mattered little when it faced supreme power.</p>

      </div>
      <p class="subsq">Levitating down to the ground, he used a simple motion to disperse all the soil and dust, revealing what had been hidden and protected within the mountain. A single crystal that had served as little more than a nurturing natural treasure. Truly a pathetic underutilization.</p>
      <p class="subsq">The ivory claw touched upon the now unbound Pylon of Civilization, and a new master claimed the territory. The environment instantly changed as the authority of a King was established. A level was gained as he walked his path of conquest and took yet another domain under his control.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Just one of many for the Fallen King to rightfully claim.</p>
