      <p class="first1"><span class="first-letter">J</span>ake remembered the very first day he had been introduced to the system. He remembered his class selection, where he’d been presented with a number of choices for a starting class. Six choices, to be exact. Of those six, one had been the Archer class.</p>
      <p class="subsq">So, if one of six starting classes was Archer… then why the fuck weren’t there any goddamn bows for sale? There were over a hundred damn legendary items, so why not a bow!?</p>
      <p class="subsq">To rub salt in the wound, there actually was a fucking crossbow. Jake refused to even look at the description when it popped up, instead seething by himself. He didn’t even want to justify why he couldn’t use one due to how his skills worked or anything like that… because it honestly didn’t matter. Jake just didn’t want to use a damn crossbow.</p>
      <p class="subsq">He would rather just throw his arrows than embarrass them by putting them in a crossbow. Roman pointing out the crossbow could automatically conjure bolts did not help that sentiment, as the man ruthlessly teased Jake and only shut up when Jake threatened to steal his staff and use that as an arrow.</p>
      <p class="subsq">But… one also had to look at the positives, because Jake did see some peculiar items. One of which came just after the cuirass had been sold off.</p>
      <div class="alignment-block">
        <div class="element">
        <p class="alignment-block-content3"><i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre1">[Blood Spear Replica (Legendary)] – </b>This spear is a replica of the legendary Blood Spear used by Sanguine himself while he still lived. The spear’s body is made of unknown wood, while the tip of spear is created from the crystallized blood of a slain A-grade vampire. Any attack made using the Blood Spear directly damages vital energy, and if a foe is slain with the Blood Spear, they will resurrect as thralls of the user. Despite being a mere replica, it still holds a morsel of the Records of the true Blood Spear, making it indestructible for all who do not wield the power of a god. <b class="calibre1">Enchantments:</b> Blood Spear.</i></p>

      </div>

      </div>
      </div>
      <p class="subsq">Now, it did not need to be said that Jake had no interest in actually buying it, but that did not make its existence any less interesting. This was the first time Jake learned that Sanguine had used a spear when he was alive, and also his first time seeing a replica of a weapon used by a god. The concept that one could borrow Records from a far more potent tool opened up quite a few possibilities.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Others clearly thought this, too, as the spear was bought for three hundred and twenty million Credits. The one who bought it was someone Jake had never even heard of, and was, according to Miranda, the leader of a small group of settlements quite a bit away from any of the major factions.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Naturally, Jake also sold off some things during this time. The Sword Saint bought the Paint Brush of Ephemeral Power for a hundred and thirty-eight million Credits—the least of anything he sold—while the Forgestone of Eternal Embers went for a whopping four hundred and three million. The brush had been a bit of a disappointment, but the Forgestone was a big win and ended up being sold to the Holy Church.</p>
      <p class="subsq">The last of his legendary items was the Supreme Escape Token. Well, technically, it was Sylphie’s item, but Jake was acting as her guardian, so legally, it was his. She wasn’t even a year old, so she still couldn’t have her own bank account, even if Jake came to learn that she did actually have Credits. She just hadn’t gotten any yet and seemed to have little concept of trade, so it was probably for the best Jake handled it. Jake was pretty confident she would have sold a legendary item for a bag of tasty snacks if possible.</p>
      <p class="subsq">He had to admit, he did not expect much of the token. It was just a coward’s tool to escape from a bad situation, and even if the mechanic to teleport to an anchor was cool, the limited uses made it not that useful, in Jake’s opinion.</p>
      <p class="subsq">So when the token ended up being the most valuable item he sold during the entire Auction, he felt somewhat miffed. Not that he complained when he got an insane ninety-six million seven hundred thousand Credits straight from the Holy Church’s coffers. Based on Sultan’s comments, he was certain the token would go to the Augur himself to keep him safe. Jake didn’t really care; he wouldn’t tell others how to spend their money even if he thought it was a stupidly high amount to spend.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Anyway, with the token, Sylphie turned out to be a real winner when it came to finding expensive stuff! Which is a good segue into what Jake did buy. Because it was for the little ball of feathers.</p>

        <p class="alignment-block-content3"><i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre1">[Omniweave Armor (Legendary)] – </b>Armor created with an extremely rare and highly adaptable type of cloth that can take the shape of nearly any piece of clothing. This was originally created as an experimental attempt to allow tamed monsters of an A-grade King of Blood to wear armor but ultimately failed due to the lack of material. This prototype, while powerful, can only fit on a creature with a small form. As the armor was made to be all-purpose, it includes internal spatial storage as well as powerful environmental-adaptation features. <b class="calibre1">Enchantments: </b>Omniweave Adaption.

      <p class="subsq">Jake had seen it and gotten an idea. He had heard Sultan talk about how it could create a great pair of bracers, or maybe even a scarf or something from it. Others also seemed to be lacking ideas, as the price only went to around thirty million—likely just to get the materials it was made from—which was when Jake swept in with his genius idea.</p>
      <p class="subsq">And genius, it was. Jake would dare anyone to disagree upon seeing the majesty that was the current Sylphie.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Because she now stood on top of his head, proudly wearing a small vest!</p>
      <p class="subsq">Jake had barely believed it possible when he had given it to her, and with the excitement and egging on from Miranda, Felicia, Eleanor, and Christen, Sylphie had finally made her little swagger vest.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Jake had ended up buying it for fifty-two million Credits, and it was no doubt the greatest purchase of the entire Auction event so far. Even if Jake didn’t get anything more, he could walk away proud.</p>
      <p class="subsq">There were only two items left in this phase, and when the second-to-last appeared, Jake groaned, as it was a damn sword. Naturally, the price jumped, people went wild, and it was sold for a high price.</p>
      <p class="subsq">All of this is to say that Jake had not gotten anything outside of buying the greatest piece of clothing ever seen with mortal eyes.</p>
      <p class="subsq">"Is it just me, or was this entire legendary auction not as good as expected?" Jake asked those around him. "I had hoped for some catalysts, or maybe a legendary tree or something like that. At least one good alchemy ingredient would have made me happy. Oh, or one of those items to upgrade another item… That would have been awesome."</p>
      <p class="subsq">Sultan shook his head in response. "The issue with those items is that everyone can use them, and even if there is no need for them here and now, many would probably prefer to save them for the future. Same as how you did not sell the Nalkar heart or the Carbonic Focusing Catalyst. In some ways… one can say they are too valuable to sell."</p>
      <p class="subsq">Jake couldn’t disagree with his words, but that didn’t make it sting any less. He also had a suspicion that much of this Auction was just people trading wealth, as they could only afford to buy anything due to they themselves selling off another legendary.</p>
      <p class="subsq">He had already given up hope when the last item appeared. Jake instantly saw it was not a bow and prepared to move on… until he noticed what it actually was.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Now… now he really wanted to punch someone in the teeth.</p>
      <div class="alignment-block">

        <p class="alignment-block-content3"><i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre1">[Quiver of Perriniality (Legendary)] – </b>A quiver created from the leather of a powerful B-grade beast with the ability to create minor subdimensions within its skin, which then stores different natural treasures to use as weapons.

      <p class="subsq">Jake did not know if he should be happy or sad as the final item appeared. It was made even worse when he saw the minimum bidding price was set at three hundred million fucking Credits. To make matters worse, he had no bloody clue who the seller was, even if there was a name attached.</p>
      <p class="subsq">"Who is that fucker who set the minimum bidding price to three hundred million?" Jake asked Sultan and Miranda.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Miranda stayed quiet, frowning, and even Sultan shook his head. "Never heard it before."</p>
      <p class="subsq">"Well, whoever he is, fuck him," Jake said as he placed a bid of three hundred million. Because of course he would.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Would he have preferred a bow? One hundred thousand percent, but he also had to admit he kind of, sort of needed a new quiver. He was still using the uncommon quiver he’d gotten way back in the tutorial, and while he had long moved on from the arrows it conjured, he still used it to store summoned arcane arrows. Mainly poisoned ones.</p>
      <p class="subsq">This new quiver looked like it could do the same, just better. However, Jake also saw some more potential from the description, especially concerning his Arrow of the Ambitious Hunter. Even if he couldn’t do what he planned on doing, the quiver should serve well as a normal quiver to store pre-prepared poisoned arrows.</p>
      <p class="subsq">After he placed the bid… ten seconds passed, and he got it. No one else had even tried to contest him, and Jake didn’t even think for a second it was because they were being nice. Who the hell even needed it besides him? Maria, maybe? Well, okay, a lot could use it, but who would be able to spend hundreds of millions on it…</p>
      <p class="subsq">Besides a sucker like him, who had just gotten fucking scammed.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Jake instantly received the quiver, immediately bound it to himself, and put it on his back. Next up, he summoned an arrow and cut his own hand on it, activating Blood of the Malefic Viper. Once it was coated in poison, he put it into the quiver and felt it sink into it like the top was a black hole.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Once it was fully inserted, he felt it within. He even felt that while the poison was decaying in potency, it was significantly slower than in the outside world. It was to the level where he could probably poison an arrow and store it for up to a day without a noticeable decay in poison potency. Waving his hand just vaguely above the quiver, the same arrow appeared. <i class="calibre4">Better than the old quiver for sure</i>, Jake thought.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Next, he tossed a bottle into the quiver, only to find it just bounced off the top like it had hit an invisible barrier. <i class="calibre4">Only arrows, I see,</i> Jake thought as another system announcement popped up.</p>
      <div class="alignment-block">

      <p class="subsq">The damn system announcement had interrupted his experimenting, and quickly skimming it, he saw there wasn’t an intermission. The entire legendary auction had taken less than three and a half hours due to them not needing the extra hour. All items had been sold within a few minutes of posting, and now it was time for the second part to begin.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Jake had begun to wonder when unique items would be sold off… and it turned out it was here, towards the end. He did also note that the system did not say how many items there were in total. Besides that, everything seemed to be as usual.</p>
      <p class="subsq">He spoke with the others a bit, but there really wasn’t much to say. Sultan had little clue as to how many unique items would appear and only knew of Jake’s own Tome. So they all sat in anticipation and discussed, and the five minutes swiftly elapsed.</p>
      <p class="subsq">When the first item appeared, Jake learned that he wasn’t the only one who had obtained an Akashic Tome during this Treasure Hunt.</p>

      </div>
      <p class="subsq">It was a bundle of sorts, displaying how one got both items. It also included some other books with information, just like Jake’s own Fulgarian Depthcaller Tome. This class was a tank-type one that revolved around blood magic and shields… Honestly, it looked a bit basic. Then again, Jake was a bit biased.</p>
      <p class="subsq">One thing was clear, though: Jake’s Tome was better. Even Sultan agreed.</p>
      <p class="subsq">"This appears to be a B-grade, maybe only C-grade, Legacy," Sultan commented. "Not the best, but has potential, I guess. The set of equipment is also valuable."</p>
      <p class="subsq">"My storage orb is Ancient," Jake stated.</p>
      <p class="subsq">"Yours is better in every way, yes, but Akashic Tomes are rarely cheap. Let us see how it develops."</p>
      <p class="subsq">And develop it did.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Jake sat there, shocked, as he watched the price climb one bid at a time. He nearly didn’t believe his eyes when the final selling price was reached… at one-point-two billion Credits.</p>
      <p class="subsq">"How the fuck…" Jake muttered.</p>
      <p class="subsq">"If you ended up with a less-than-ideal class at D-grade… this might be your only real way to improve before getting an evolution," Sultan said, shaking his head. "As for the buyer… I do not know of them. Likely simply someone who got lucky with a sale in a prior round to afford it. Or a powerful independent party coming together… It may even be a proxy by a large faction made to buy it, as things are no longer anonymous."</p>
      <p class="subsq">Jake nodded, even if he thought it a waste of money. If you got a downright shitty class at D-grade, was it really worth it to try and get a better one instead of pushing yourself and evolving to C-grade? Or were people just that desperate?</p>
      <p class="subsq">Either way, it looked like these Akashic Tomes had insane value. So when Jake saw the next item was another Tome, he was certain it would rake in cash.</p>

      <p class="subsq">Jake was wrong. As it turned out, no one wanted to learn how to brew fine wine using blood. It even had an accompanying book and a description written by the seller, really trying to play it up. Yet the interest was so low it was kind of comical, and it ended up being bought for forty-two million to someone from the Noboru clan.</p>
      <p class="subsq"><i class="calibre4">Were they planning on becoming vampires?</i> Jake considered. Maybe some of them were…</p>
      <p class="subsq">Vampire samurai… Yeah, that actually sounded kind of dope.</p>
      <p class="subsq">As it had been sold rather quickly, there was another waiting period. Jake looked at the ceiling of the booth he was in, really hoping something good would show up—if not now, then during that special phase rewarded due to their performance in the Treasure Hunt.</p>
      <p class="subsq">What he didn’t know was that the final phase would have items he would surely classify as ghost pepper-level spicy.</p>
