      <p class="first1"><span class="first-letter">C</span>aleb used his Hunter Insignia to leave the Treasure Hunt, finding himself back inside his main office located in the center of Skyggen. He quickly checked the time via a clock on the wall and saw that only a bit less than ten hours had passed since the Hunt began.</p>
      <p class="subsq">He briefly reflected on the battle between the Sword Saint and his brother, but quickly shook his head and got to work. There was loot to categorize, and when he got the message about the Auction a moment later, he naturally also added that to his to-do list.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Just as he was exiting the office, one of the workers slammed the door open, surprising Caleb.</p>
      <p class="subsq">"Judge, hurry! We had an invader, and something is going on at your home!"</p>
      <p class="subsq">Caleb stopped for a moment as he let the words sink in. Without any hesitation, he activated a skill. His body turned to lightning, not even giving his aide a chance to elaborate on the situation.</p>
      <p class="subsq">He flew through the city for a few moments before his residence came into view. He saw it surrounded by people, including some of the recently returned D-grades. With a sinking feeling in his stomach, he slammed down in front of them all and turned corporeal.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Pushing past the people around, he saw that they were taking a defensive perimeter. The situation was tense, but when he saw his wife holding his son while standing with some of the guards, Caleb breathed out a sigh of relief and hurried over.</p>
      <p class="subsq">"Maja, what happened!?" he said loudly as soon as he was within earshot.</p>
      <p class="subsq">She looked calmer than he expected, given all the commotion, and when she saw him, she just shook her head. "I already told them everything is fine, and they’re just overreacting."</p>
      <p class="subsq">"Ma’am, an intruder managed to break through all the barriers and enter the residence without being detected…" one of the guards beside her said.</p>
      <p class="subsq">"And he didn’t do anything besides talking once he did," Maja countered.</p>
      <p class="subsq">"Give me a rundown," Caleb ordered the guard.</p>
      <p class="subsq">"Sir, approximately two hours ago, an individual managed to sneak into the city, get through the barrier around the residence, and enter without being detected," the guard quickly answered. “We only became aware when he triggered an alarm on the way out, and guards are currently in pursuit, joined by Matteo and Nadia.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">Caleb frowned as he considered it. Someone had purposefully waited for the Treasure Hunt to enter, and based on their ability to sneak in, they had to be at least D-grade… meaning they’d purposefully chosen not to join it. <i class="calibre4">Who the hell?</i></p>
      <p class="subsq">"What did he want?" he asked his wife.</p>
      <p class="subsq">"Just to talk,” she explained with a shrug. “He wanted information about you and Jake. Just regular stuff… like who you were and what you did before the system. He even asked questions about you two growing up, and it didn’t feel malicious in any way.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">"Who was he? Did you get a name?"</p>
      <p class="subsq">"Just a young man. Now that I think about it, he never gave a name. He said he was friends with Jake and knew quite a lot about him—he even told me about Jake’s tutorial—and it was pleasant enough. Debra and Robert didn’t even consider not answering, as we all assumed he had gotten in with permission with a proven identity. And again, nothing seemed weird. Just an old friend of Jake’s who had gotten separated from him after the tutorial and wanted to get to know you and him better. It was only once he left that we figured out something was wrong, as he tripped the alarm, and then all hell broke loose. That was about fifteen minutes ago."</p>
      <p class="subsq">Caleb’s frown deepened. The entire situation was just too damn weird. The alarm was far easier to avoid when exiting than when getting in. Why sneak in, to begin with, if he hadn’t done so with bad intentions? Not to mention purposefully triggering the alarm when he left.</p>
      <p class="subsq">"Where are Mom and Dad?" he asked.</p>
      <p class="subsq">"Just inside; I decided to go out and handle it," Maja answered as she held the sleeping baby. "I don’t really think any of this is a big deal?"</p>
      <p class="subsq">Nodding, Caleb considered her words and turned to the guard. "What direction did they leave in?"</p>
      <p class="subsq">The guard made it easier than a mere direction by giving him a locator for Matteo.</p>
      <p class="subsq">"Maja, go inside and wait, okay? I’ll check it out," Caleb said as he gave her a hug.</p>
      <p class="subsq">"Okay,” Maja answered. “Please don’t get into any unnecessary fights; he didn’t seem like a bad person.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">"Of course."</p>
      <p class="subsq">With that, Caleb took flight again by turning to black lightning and followed the locator towards Matteo. His head was filled with potential scenarios, none of them quite making sense. Was it the Holy Church? It was a possibility, as he was never quite sure what they were doing. It had to be someone powerful—not just in infiltration, but also mental magic… because Maja sure as hell wasn’t acting normally for just having had someone break into their home.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Was it the undead? No… no, Maja would have noticed even with the mental influence. Valhal? Why would they? Also, using mental magic was not in their MO. An independent faction? Did they even have anyone strong enough to break in? Honestly, Caleb was lost for possibilities. Unless it was an inside job, it was hard to determine who it could be, and even then, he would know of someone with such skills.</p>
      <p class="subsq"><i class="calibre4">I guess I will have to investigate directly.</i></p>
      <p class="subsq">He soared across the terrain and the settlement built within the hidden valley, seeing the ever-growing city. Soon, he was outside the border, and he kept flying onwards, sensing himself getting closer and closer to where Matteo and the others were.</p>
      <p class="subsq">It only took him ten or so minutes before he spotted something in the distance, and what he saw wasn’t what he expected. He saw a large cube of silver-like metal. Matteo was somewhere within.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Without any hesitation, Caleb summoned his staff and smashed down on the cube, breaking the roof and hitting the ground within. Orienting himself, his eyes opened wide at the sight of Nadia and a dozen or so other assassins all lying on the ground. Some were missing limbs and covered in blood, some turned partially to metal. In the center was an armored figure holding the passed-out Matteo.</p>
      <p class="subsq">"You got here faster than expected," the armored figure said as he let down Matteo’s unconscious body.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Caleb did a quick check and found that not a single one of the assassins was dead. <i class="calibre4">Who the fuck?</i></p>
      <p class="subsq">He tried to use Identify but got a somewhat expected response.</p>
      <div class="alignment-block">
        <div class="element">
        <p class="alignment-block-content3"><b class="calibre1">[Human – lvl ?]</b></p>
      </div>
      </div>
      <p class="subsq"><i class="calibre4">A skill to obscure it</i>.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Caleb took a defensive position, not willing to underestimate the person before him, and asked, "Who are you, and why are you here? What the hell do you want with my family?"</p>
      <p class="subsq">The person just regarded him. "You two look a lot alike, and even your demeanors are similar. Seeing you, it makes more sense, as I was beginning to doubt Debra and Robert were truly his parents. I do wonder how such regular people can give birth to you two… but I guess it is related to the Bloodline?"</p>
      <p class="subsq">Frowning, Caleb listened while working his identification skill to pierce the other guy’s obfuscation skill. He managed to after a while, and was shocked when he saw the level.</p>
      <div class="alignment-block">
        <div class="element">
        <p class="alignment-block-content3"><b class="calibre1">[Human – lvl 172]</b></p>
      </div>
      </div>
      <p class="subsq"><i class="calibre4">How the hell?</i> Caleb thought as he began formulating a plan to retreat. But he also had an idea regarding the identity of the person in front of him.</p>
      <p class="subsq">"You must be William."</p>
      <p class="subsq">Caleb just didn’t see any other possibilities, and when the armor of the person in front of him retracted, his suspicions were confirmed. But he looked slightly different than what Caleb had heard. He was supposed to be a teenager, but he was clearly older by at least a few years.</p>
      <p class="subsq">"Well, at least you know my name… Your brother didn’t, the last time we met," William answered calmly. "I guess you are the one who inherited all the Intelligence points, huh?"</p>
      <p class="subsq">"Why are you here?" Caleb cut to the chase, not wanting to bicker meaninglessly. Another reason was due to the constant influence he felt. Some kind of mental skill was slowly attempting to bore into his mind, so the longer he spent, the more dangerous it would become.</p>
      <p class="subsq">"Wow, both of you somehow managed to develop such rudeness despite having two perfectly polite parents. As for why I am here? Master always talks about how information is the true path to victory and the best way to overcome gaps. So I am gathering intelligence." William smiled. "I must admit, it was more pleasant than expected. It turns out that having non-shitty parents does a lot for a kid’s development, allowing even a freak like your brother to learn how to function within a civilized society."</p>
      <p class="subsq">Frowning, Caleb felt more and more unsure about the entire situation. For the disciple of Eversmile to show up like this was clearly no coincidence, especially given the timing. He had somehow known when the Treasure Hunt would end, timed it, and left just before Caleb returned, then baited him to follow. It was a trap he had walked straight into, but he had no idea what the purpose of the trap was quite yet. So instead, he tried to probe for information.</p>
      <p class="subsq">"My brother has always been a bit special, but I don’t think he was ever quite a basket-case like you,” Caleb said. “I do wonder, how did you manage to find a way out of our universe this fast? Much less spend all your potential time in D-grade within Nevermore?"</p>
      <p class="subsq">Off-world teleportation was something the forces of Earth were all working on to connect with their factions in other universes. While they could not offer much assistance, it would give the inhabitants access to areas and opportunities elsewhere. Such as where William had clearly been, based on his aged appearance: Nevermore. It was the only dungeon Caleb was aware of with built-in time dilation without any negative consequences, besides the limited amount of time one could spend there per grade. Based on Caleb’s estimates and his aged appearance, William had to have spent a few years in Nevermore to get to his current level.</p>
      <p class="subsq">But, even if he could leave and go to Nevermore… why do it? He had not attended the World Congress, which one could argue wasn’t really missing much, but the Treasure Hunt? It gave a title that was massive by multiverse standards, and, of course, it was a lot of loot lost just to do something anyone could do anyway once they found a way to other universes. So why would Eversmile make William do that, or—if it was William’s own idea—allow him to?</p>
      <p class="subsq">One thing had to be clear: traveling to another universe wasn’t actually that hard. Well, it was, but it only had to be for one side—either the receiver or sender. This meant the other side could soak up all the cost of bringing someone from the 93rd Universe, and the same when sending them back. All you needed was someone sufficiently skilled to put down the transfer formation on Earth, which a talented mid-tier D-grade space mage should be capable of.</p>
      <p class="subsq">"I have my means and my reasons," William answered nonchalantly. “So does my master. But enough about me… I am not here to fight, as if I was, everyone around us would be dead. We would also already be in the midst of it—if you wouldn’t be dead already, that is.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">Caleb, annoyingly, was unable to dispute it. While he did believe he could escape… the level gap was too high for him to want to risk anything.</p>
      <p class="subsq">"Not here," Caleb answered.</p>
      <p class="subsq">He still didn’t rule out that it could lead to a fight, and fighting with his unconscious allies around him wouldn’t be wise. Also… he had already sent back an emergency message to Skyggen, making his family go to a safe house, so he needed to buy at least a bit more time. Assistance was also coming, but not to fight. They would not be helpful, and he’d only called them to retrieve the injured.</p>
      <p class="subsq">William smiled in agreement, the metal cube surrounding him folding up and shrinking as he absorbed it into his body.</p>
      <p class="subsq">The moment it did, Caleb’s eyes opened wide. All around him was a net of thousands of wires. William absorbed that too, making Caleb fully aware of how much of a trap he had just entered.</p>
      <p class="subsq">"Let’s go, then," Caleb said, faking being unfazed as he headed directly away from the city, William following after.</p>
      <p class="subsq">While William clearly wanted information from Caleb, Caleb would also try and use this chance to figure out what the hell William had been doing. Most importantly, who had managed to make a teleportation circle able to transport out of their universe ahead of any of the major forces. The fact that he didn’t know about it also meant the Court of Shadows didn’t know… and while it was incredibly difficult for the gods to peer into their universe, the fact that no one had known had to mean the Primordial who had blessed William was ultimately behind it.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Now the only question was if William was a player in the game of his master, or just another pawn thinking he was.</p>
