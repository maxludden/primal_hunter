      <p class="first1"><span class="first-letter">J</span>ake watched the battle again, this time already knowing the outcome, allowing him to focus on aspects he hadn’t before. He observed their clashes and primarily the Viper, keeping a close eye on the claws and the poison running through them at all times.</p>
      <p class="subsq">He focused on the axe warrior and his indomitable will.</p>
      <p class="subsq">On the way that the Viper used all his skills and manipulated magic.</p>
      <p class="subsq">He focused on everything he could as time rewound again after the Viper escaped, and Jake once more intimately experienced the escape skill related to Wings of the Malefic Viper. Soon after the escape skill was used, time rewound, and Jake experienced everything again.</p>
      <p class="subsq">This happened a dozen times, as the Path of the Heretic-Chosen skill stayed active longer than ever before. Perhaps it was due to it consuming two attempts, or maybe it was due to the way this attempt worked, but either way, it allowed Jake to learn more than before.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Fang and Wings were the two skills truly in focus, yet Jake felt like he learned just as much from Valdemar as he did the Viper. The man was what Jake could only describe as inspirational. His utter aura of dominance and Willpower that didn’t allow a single trace of doubt to enter his mind, as well as skills that synergized with this, made him an absolute monster. He truly never made a move believing it wouldn’t work, nor did he continue to fight if he believed he couldn’t win. Was this delusional? Perhaps… but it clearly worked for him.</p>
      <p class="subsq">He was the epitome of a warrior despite not necessarily being the most skilled fighter from a technical point of view. Every attack was infused with every fragment of his will, and every atom of his body radiated battle intent. Jake was in awe the more he looked on, but sadly the period of the skill was soon over.</p>
      <p class="subsq">He experienced traveling with Wings a final time as he focused on it, but he felt he was still a distance away from fully comprehending it. In fact, he had learned a lot more related to Fangs, as he felt he was just on the cusp of comprehension.</p>
      <p class="subsq">But then something changed. Jake flew away with the Viper, but instead of time rewinding or the vision ending, Jake was returned to Valdemar and the golden orb. The axe warrior’s weapon had broken from that final strike, so he stood unarmed and looked up at the orb as he breathed heavily.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Then he took out a bottle from some spatial inventory and opened it. He went over to a pool of the Viper’s blood and poured the liquid from the bottle out onto it.</p>
      <p class="subsq">"Cheers, mates, first drink’s on you guys. I bloody won," he said as he took a whisk of the bottle himself, and to Jake’s amazement, his wounds stopped festering soon after, as he’d stabilized himself from all the poison in his body.</p>
      <p class="subsq">It wasn’t a healing potion or an antidote, but alcohol so fucking pure it washed out and neutralized much of the poison. It was not a cure, but at most a temporary fix. Not that Jake in any way thought it possible the man would succumb to his wounds, even without knowing he had later become a god.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Valdemar then finally turned his attention towards the golden orb as he flew up to it, the barrier around it fading in the process. The orb was nearly a hundred meters in diameter, but when the man laid his hand upon it, the size reduced to fit in his palm. He looked at it briefly before putting it into his storage, flying down to the ground again, and taking out another bottle of alcohol as well as two mugs.</p>
      <p class="subsq">"One for the legend made today!" he said as he poured the liquid into one of the mugs. It was a golden, ale-like drink of sorts, and the mugs were both old and wooden. "And one for those of tomorrow!"</p>
      <p class="subsq">With the second mug filled, he placed it on a stone away from him and lifted the first mug to drink.</p>
      <p class="subsq">"To victory!" he yelled as he raised the mug in triumph, and for a fraction of a moment, Jake felt like Valdemar looked straight at him. Then the vision ended, and the skill came to an end.</p>

      <p class="first2">The projections had been in an uproar when, without any warning, the testee disappeared. Not just gone invisible or been teleported, but literally disappeared from existence according to every method of Perception they had. Nearly every method.</p>
      <p class="subsq">"His Truesoul is still anchored here," a projection in charge of the dungeon monitoring tool said. It was only detectable due to direct system assistance from the dungeon, allowing not even the S-grades there to know what had happened.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Which meant whatever had made him disappear had to be either directly done by the system or perhaps a Bloodline or a Transcendent. Transcendent was more probable, no matter how improbable it was for a D-grade to have one.</p>
      <p class="subsq">"Are you su—"</p>
      <p class="subsq">Before the question was asked, the human reappeared. Instantly, something felt different, as the Hydra also stopped up.</p>
      <p class="subsq">The human turned his head towards the Hydra and muttered, "Fangs… huh…"</p>
      <p class="subsq">None of the judges knew what he meant, but whatever had happened in the brief moment he was gone had somehow led to a change none of them was quite sure of.</p>
      <p class="subsq">The scalekin looked on, genuinely wishing for the human to win.</p>
      <p class="subsq">"He is in a state of enlightenment," the beastkin said, frowning before he grinned. "This might not be over quite yet."</p>

      <p class="first2">Jake returned to the "real world" as he processed what he had just experienced. His mind was still occupied when the Hydra stopped a few hundred meters away, looking on with newfound caution. Jake himself only now noticed he had gotten a notification quite a bit ago… about halfway through the vision.</p>

      <p class="subsq">Ignoring the danger of the Hydra being able to close in and attack at any moment, Jake checked the new skill out and finally managed to clear away that one eyesore of a skill from his status sheet.</p>

      <p class="subsq">Jake stood there, holding the broken wooden stick in one hand and Eternal Hunger in the other. The Bloodfeast Dagger had fallen to the ground a dozen or so meters away, but Jake wasn’t in a hurry to pick it back up.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Instead, he looked towards the Hydra and held the stick. It was sharp, and Jake knew instinctually that his new skill worked with it. He grasped it tighter, but then felt it break, as his grip was just too strong for it to handle. Jake frowned, and he knew it wasn’t right. It didn’t feel right yet.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Valdemar had flooded the fang with energy… No, with a sense of self. A sense of ownership that had truly made it into his weapon. Made it part of him. He also remembered what Villy had said about warriors seeing their weapons as extensions of their bodies through long-term nurturing. But Valdemar’s was not that. To him, in that moment, anything could become the axe that was the arbiter of his will.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Jake picked up another stick as the Hydra looked on cautiously. It was still healing, so it wasn’t losing out by doing so, and besides… it didn’t seem smart enough to know what Jake was doing or trying to do. Not that Jake was entirely sure either.</p>
      <p class="subsq">The new stick was as weak as the one before, but Jake tried again. Not to recreate some concept, but simply to replicate that feeling. A few moments passed as a bit of energy invaded the stick, only for it to explode, getting a touch of movement out of the Hydra that now no longer wanted to just observe passively.</p>
      <p class="subsq">It charged as Jake wielded Eternal Hunger and picked up another stick with a string of mana. He met the Hydra’s charge, and the battle began again. From the point of view of the Hydra, it had only been around a minute since it had smashed Jake away, but to him, it had been hours. Hours that felt longer than usual due to his feeling of inspiration and the effects of Path of the Heretic-Chosen.</p>
      <p class="subsq">This meant Jake’s mindset had had time to change, and the momentum of the fight had reset. An unexpected bonus for sure, but a very welcome one. Jake did hamper himself a little as he dove into the battle, not necessarily fighting to win, but to capitalize on his enlightenment through combat.</p>
      <p class="subsq">The two of them clashed, and Jake was slightly faster than before, likely due to the increased Agility, or maybe just because he was calmer and less frustrated than before. He dodged away from the mouth of the Hydra and cut with Eternal Hunger. The blade sliced through the scales a bit better than before. It was slight, but there.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Just after landing a blow, he was smashed back, but he stabilized and attacked again. He ran on pure inspiration as he smashed down the wooden stick, only for it to break on the scales. Then he was sent tumbling back from a snapping maw.</p>
      <p class="subsq">But he saw it. A small nick in the scale.</p>
      <p class="subsq">With a string of mana, he got another stick and dove in. He slipped under an attack and stabbed again in failure. This kept up a few more times as Jake got more and more injured, but he also felt like he got closer and closer.</p>
      <p class="subsq">To the Hydra, it was clearly winning, but to Jake, he felt like he got closer and closer to victory. He was repeatedly retaliated, returning with new sticks to try and stab with. He was in some ways lucky that he kept getting smashed through trees, as it allowed him to get him new materials for his self-made stick spears.</p>
      <p class="subsq"><i class="calibre4">Not quite right,</i> Jake thought as he frowned. <i class="calibre4">Still not right… I need more… It needs to be like his…</i></p>
      <p class="subsq">Valdemar had truly made it part of himself. Like an extension of his body. It was entirely different, and Jake wasn’t delusional enough to believe he could copy the skill of an S-grade future Primordial, but he at least believed he was on the right track and could make something out of it. He was not satisfied with the current skill and would take it further.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Jake went all out, breaking nearly a hundred sticks before something suddenly clicked. He lifted a stick and slammed it down. The Hydra had started to ignore such moves, but that now changed. A notification sounded out in Jake’s mind. He felt like the stick was truly a part of himself, and to the surprise of both Jake and the Hydra, it managed to break through the scales and embed itself a few centimeters into the flesh of the Hydra.</p>
      <p class="subsq">It didn’t stop there. Eternal Hunger changed even more, and Jake cleaved down and left a deep wound, sending blood and scales flying into the air.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Before Jake could celebrate, he was smashed back by a tail swipe. He tumbled to the ground before quickly getting up, unable to hold back his curiosity as he checked the system notification.</p>

      <p class="subsq">Jake felt the inspiration rush in as he smirked. It wasn’t even close to the level of what Valdemar had done, but it was progress… right?</p>
      <p class="subsq">He also felt Eternal Hunger more than ever before as the faint roar of the Chimera in his Truesoul sounded out within his mind. It was utterly suppressed the next moment by his will—not that it was necessary, as Eternal Hunger was clearly on his team in this fight.</p>
      <p class="subsq">It wanted to win and to drain the life of the Hydra. The life energy within the beast was far more valuable and of a higher level than anything Jake had ever fought before, and the weapon knew that. It was a qualitative difference that was recognized.</p>
      <p class="subsq">So Jake bent his knees and prepared to charge forward with his new weapon—no, fang—in hand. The fang of a human. And as a fang, was it not natural that something else would follow? He had experienced and realized his inspiration in relation to Valdemar, but that was not all. One more thing now dominated his mind.</p>
      <p class="subsq"><i class="calibre4">This is my fang… so as the Viper could use his claws, I can use this.</i></p>
      <p class="subsq">The weapon itself felt like a part of his body—like his own arm, if still a bit separate. One could liken it to a prosthetic, but one he could still vaguely feel, the same as he could “feel” his nails, teeth, and hair. It wasn’t truly living or a part of him, but the system still considered it part of his Soulshape.</p>
      <p class="subsq">He knew the weapon was still below that, as hair and nails and such would heal naturally, while the weapon would not due to its temporary nature. Either way, it was still far stronger, as he intimately felt the energy move through Eternal Hunger while he prepared his fang to strike and move his next goal.</p>
      <p class="subsq">It was time to raise the rarity of the second skill: Fang of the Malefic Viper.</p>
