      <p class="first2">Four entire fucking days was how long Jake spent just zooming through the terrain, traveling faster than two commercial planes stacked on top of each other—with better fuel efficiency, too, and way less carbon emission.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Since the start of the tutorial, this had been the most boring period with nothing interesting happening. Jake felt bad about nagging Villy, so he didn’t want to constantly ask him about stuff, and while Sylphie was interesting to communicate with, it had to be done in small doses.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Additionally, the King sleeping in the mask was a real lazy one, not waking up a single time during this period no matter how much he poked it. Or maybe he was just being ignored. Either way, it sucked.</p>
      <p class="subsq">But! Finally, he noticed that the compass seemed to move more back and forth whenever he didn’t run in a straight line, indicating he was getting close. And it truly was about time.</p>
      <p class="subsq">For these four days, Jake had not had a single good fight. He had had a few scuffles with beasts, but all of them either got out of his way or weren’t strong enough to put up a good fight. It had been mostly flat land between Haven and Skyggen, and the few mountain chains, forests, or large lakes he’d come across could either be flown over or just run through. Well, he had dodged an especially large mountain, as it quite frankly would’ve taken too long to try and get over. Jake had really wanted to explore it but had held himself back.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Anyway, to summarize, Jake had found at least a few interesting places to explore if he had to run back to Haven again, or even if he wanted to go on a bit of an adventure someday.</p>
      <p class="subsq">A few more hours passed before Jake finally saw something far in the distance. It was night by now, and he saw faint lights on the horizon. He sped up as he finally felt his journey nearing its end, and he promised himself to, in the future, ask about the time required for travel. Though, to be fair… chances were Neil hadn’t known.</p>
      <p class="subsq">With one last push, Jake came over a hill and the city finally came into view. It was a large settlement, even larger than the Fort by a great deal, and Jake had to admit he was impressed so much had been built in such a short amount of time.</p>
      <p class="subsq">The entire city was placed on the plains with a large mountainside to the east and a wall surrounding it. Jake headed down, but when he got closer, he felt like something was off.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Courtesy of his Bloodline, Jake always had a good general feeling about the overall aura of an area. He could get a rough estimate for how powerful the people or beasts were, and when he was close to Skyggen, it just felt too weak. Sure, there were some D-grades, but far from as many as he would assume.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Frowning, he naturally continued toward it and double-checked the compass, which was still pointing directly to somewhere in the city. So he was going in no matter what.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Now the only question was… should he sneak in or use the front gate?</p>
