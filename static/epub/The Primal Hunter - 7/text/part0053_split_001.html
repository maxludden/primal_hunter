      <p class="first1"><span class="first-letter">A</span>n annoying ringing sound reminiscent of his old alarm woke Jake up from his nap. With a start, he sat up, only to groan in pain. His body still hurt like hell. He wondered what was going on as the alarm kept blaring in his head until he finally found the cause.</p>
      <p class="subsq">"Villy… are you cosplaying as an alarm clock?"</p>
      <p class="subsq"><i class="calibre4">"I was going more for a phone alarm with the most annoying option selected, actually,"</i> the god answered.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Jake was about to ask why the god was doing that, but he instantly realized the reason, and Villy also gladly reminded him.</p>
      <p class="subsq"><i class="calibre4">"Let us just ignore the fact that you effectively just demoted your own Patron</i>—<i class="calibre4">a Primordial</i>—<i class="calibre4">to a damn alarm to remind you of your own damn scheduled system events,"</i> Villy said in a half-joking, half-scolding way. <i class="calibre4">"Not that I am surprised. In fact, I am beginning to see a pattern here. Do you just like hunting dangerous prey while under time pressure? Either way, you got ten minutes till it begins, so get going with all the stuff."</i></p>
      <p class="subsq">"If it is worth anything, then you are the best alarm clock I have ever had," Jake said with a smile as he stood up.</p>
      <p class="subsq">He had been using the now rapidly decaying corpse of the Panther as a bed, and he was a little bit dirty. Not to mention how his armor was shredded, his body filled with holes that were still healing.</p>
      <p class="subsq"><i class="calibre4">"It is not,"</i> Villy said. <i class="calibre4">"Now go on with what you have to do. We will talk more after the system event. If my guess is correct, this one will be like the others and not necessarily only concern Earth. Good luck with it all… and good fight, mate."</i></p>
      <p class="subsq">Jake nodded in appreciation, a smile still on his lips. He hurt all over, but he felt elated. Killing a C-grade was not easy, and the Phantomshade Panther was not a weak C-grade either. Checking his notifications, he saw that while the beast had been C-grade, it was only barely. Also, the clone level had been right.</p>

      <p class="subsq">Jake had gained five levels from that one fight. Killing a level 199 didn’t even give him a full level anymore unless it was a particularly strong specimen, so seeing how much he got truly demonstrated the difference between D- and C-grades.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Jake turned his attention to the beast in question and began using Alchemist’s Purification to remove the last of the remnant poison lingering behind. Once done, he checked for loot and found a C-grade Beastcore attuned to dark and space affinities… and something even more interesting.</p>
      <p class="subsq">It was a black fang that hummed with intense energy. Jake frowned as he looked at it, but he quickly realized what type of item it was.</p>
      <div class="alignment-block">
        <div class="element">
        <p class="alignment-block-content3"><i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre1">[Partly Digested Phantomshade Fang (Unique)] – </b>A Phantomshade Fang granted by the system to the newly integrated 93rd Universe.

This fang is already partly digested, having only a bit of the original energy left.</i></p>
      </div>
      </div>
      <p class="subsq">It was something like the Mystbone that Mystie had absorbed to quickly reach D-grade, but a far more potent version… perhaps one good enough to push a beast to C-grade. It had clearly helped and forged the Path of the Panther.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Jake picked it up and put it in his inventory along with the corpse of the fallen beast. The pelt was not worth much, but he still wanted to take it with him and not leave it rotting on the ground. A C-grade corpse had to have some innate value, and this one had even been strong.</p>
      <p class="subsq">After his looting, there was just one more thing. When he had escaped that spatial tunnel with Moment of the Primal Hunter active, Jake had managed to go above and beyond anything prior, thus upgrading One Step Mile. With great excitement, he saw the notification.</p>
      <div class="alignment-block">
        <div class="element">

      <p class="subsq">Jake had to have a few takes as he looked at the descriptions… where nothing had changed. Okay, saying nothing was not accurate. One fucking word was gone. It had gone from "there must be a clear path" to "there must be a path," which was so damn minuscule it barely counted. Was that all his improved ability to pass through barriers and such boiled down to?</p>
      <p class="subsq">But… the rarity had upgraded along with the skill name. Jake wondered what was up with that and quickly pinged the Viper, knowing the god was still watching.</p>
      <p class="subsq">"Hey… One Step Mile, or, well, One Step, Thousand Miles, as it is called now… What is up with that skill?"</p>
      <p class="subsq"><i class="calibre4">"What do you mean?"</i> the god gladly asked in return.</p>
      <p class="subsq">"It just upgraded, but nothing really changed?"</p>
      <p class="subsq"><i class="calibre4">"Isn’t it better now? What did you expect to change?"</i> Villy wasn’t speaking in a teasing tone, but a very serious one.</p>
      <p class="subsq">"I am just used to skills kind of, you know, changing when upgrading. This one just got a bit better, and nothing else." Jake shrugged, but he began to understand what the Viper meant. What would he expect to change?</p>
      <p class="subsq"><i class="calibre4">"I believe I have mentioned this before, but the One Step line of skills is far more powerful than you give it credit for. It is a skill known to pretty much anyone of power and influence, gained by far more individuals than you would expect. It is simple, elegant, and a core skill that has been around since… forever. It is a skill with a clear upgrade path all the way to a rank I have never heard of anyone reaching</i>.”</p>
      <p class="subsq">"So, it is a bit like your ‘of the Malefic Viper’ skills?" Jake asked.</p>
      <p class="subsq"><i class="calibre4">"Yes and no. Those are Legacy skills bound to me and my Records. One Step is a skill that originated from the system itself, as far as I know. It is not bound to any individual or any Path; it merely is. The skill is one that you can keep upgrading and using all the way to the pinnacle, going from simply stepping a bit through space for a few meters to, with a single step, appearing anywhere in existence you so desire. However, fundamentally it will never change, and will always be about the simplest of actions and concepts</i>—<i class="calibre4">to take a step, moving you towards your destination."</i></p>
      <p class="subsq">Jake nodded along at the explanation and began to appreciate the simple skill even more. Thinking about it, didn’t it fit him quite nicely? It was simple and easy to use and understand, just the way he liked it.</p>
      <p class="subsq">"Thanks for the exposition on the deep lore of my movement skill," Jake thanked the Viper, only half-joking.</p>
      <p class="subsq"><i class="calibre4">"No problem. Goodbye again. For real this time. You got like five seconds."</i></p>
      <p class="subsq">"Yep," Jake said, having already seen the timer, and as it expired, the quest Jake already had updated.</p>

      </div>
      </div>
      <p class="subsq">Jake took out the key from his inventory and used Identify on it once more. He had expected it and was proven correct when the description updated.</p>
      <div class="alignment-block">

      <p class="subsq">One thing was sure: This event was different. Jake was not just teleported to it after accepting a system prompt, but could now choose to teleport there. Nothing said he had to go right away either. Oh, but he would.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Jake deposited a healing potion into his mouth and, looking like someone who had just survived a fight to the death with an incredibly powerful opponent, used the key. A portal opened up in front of him, and feeling no sense of danger, he stepped through.</p>
      <p class="subsq">It was finally time to find out what all of that Prima stuff was all about.</p>
      <p class="implicit-break"></p>
      <p class="first2">Caleb stood in front of the two people who had managed to get keys along with himself. Nadia, the sniper, and Matteo, the second-in-command, had teamed up and hunted down seven Primas together, with Caleb naturally taking care of his own key.</p>
      <p class="subsq">"According to Umbra, this event has a high likelihood of allowing us to meet or even potentially pit us against individuals from elsewhere in our universe," Caleb explained to them. "This quest is far from unique to our world, and other planets have also been tasked with hunting down Primas to gain keys. All of this is to say, do not engage with anyone not from the Court. While we may be viewed as at least a little influential on this planet, we should not ever underestimate what other monsters may lurk in a near-endless universe."</p>
      <p class="subsq">The two of them nodded. They’d had this conversation before, but he believed it prudent to reiterate.</p>
      <p class="subsq">"As for the Myriad Paths event, simply do as you see fit—though I would prefer if you don’t come out the other end ardent followers of the Holy Church after truly seeing the light." Caleb’s joke got a chuckle out of Matteo.</p>
      <p class="subsq">He smiled at them and nodded as they all took out their keys, and he opened a portal.</p>
      <p class="subsq">"Let’s go, then."</p>
      <p class="implicit-break"></p>
      <p class="first2">Miranda had to admit things had gone a lot more smoothly than expected when it came to collecting keys, and was honestly amazed at how many people from Haven would go. Herself and Arnold made sense, as they had teamed up, but Sultan had also managed to get one. Neil and his party had only gotten a single fragment, but that had been put to good use… kind of.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Sultan had also gained three fragments and thus a key. Rather than hunt for them himself, he had simply bought one from Neil and his party along with fragments from two other independent parties. This meant that, counting Jake and Sylphie, five people from Haven would go, matching if not exceeding many of the major factions.</p>
      <p class="subsq">They did not have any plans going in like the other factions, as they were effectively five independent people who just lived out of Haven. Arnold and Sultan were very much their own men and not people Miranda could tell what to do in any capacity. Sylphie and Jake were… well, Sylphie and Jake.</p>
      <p class="subsq"><i class="calibre4">Let us hope this event offers something valuable,</i> she thought as she went through her own portal, Arnold and Sultan no doubt also going through their own.</p>
      <p class="implicit-break"></p>
      <p class="first2">Carmen looked at the key and smiled a bit. She turned her head to her mother and gave her a nod. Things in Paradise had stabilized, and Carmen had spent the time since parting with Jake hunting in the surrounding area and making sure everything went smoothly back in the city. Her mother had taken over operations and the employees her family had controlled before, all with the blessing of Renato, who gladly offered a helping hand.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Not that Carmen cared particularly much about the family business. She cared much more about the upcoming event.</p>
      <p class="subsq">"You ready to go?" Carmen asked the green bird currently lying flat on the bed.</p>
      <p class="subsq">"Ree!" Sylphie answered, with Carmen naturally not understanding at all.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Sylphie had been busy doing… something up in the air and had come back very happy, so Carmen assumed she had succeeded in whatever she was up to.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Carmen just smiled and summoned the portal.</p>
      <p class="subsq">"Take care," her mother said.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Carmen nodded in response and said her goodbyes as she and Sylphie went through the portal.</p>
      <p class="implicit-break"></p>
      <p class="first2">All over the planet—and even on other planets—individuals had collected keys and entered their respective portals. Rather than an event limited to a planet, it was one involving the entire universe. Future overlords of the world, leaders of the largest factions, and champions of their time would enter their own respective Seats of the Exalted Prima.</p>
      <p class="subsq">It was an event that would be the start of much conflict and lay the foundation for alliances to come. It was the first opportunity for factions to potentially meet up with members from other planets. For trade relations to be formed. Grudges to be born. Friendships to form.</p>
      <p class="subsq">And fated enemies having their very first meeting.</p>
