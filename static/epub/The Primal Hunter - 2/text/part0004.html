      <p class="first1"><span class="first-letter">O</span>n a normal Monday morning, our main character Jake suddenly finds himself thrown into a new world in the form of a Tutorial with a system, stats, dungeons, and a forest filled with beasts wanting to eat him and his colleagues. Very standard LitRPG apocalypse stuff.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Jake quickly learns he is far more suited for this kind of world than the modern one he came from and, with a bow in hand, begins his quest for power. A quest that leads to conflict and disagreements as Jake eventually splits up with his colleagues and heads off on his own.</p>
      <p class="subsq">On his own, Jake explores and finds a special Challenge Dungeon filled with lethal traps, lore of an old organization worshipping some scaled snake god named the Malefic Viper, and a chance to inherit the legacy of this Viper in the form of alchemy. A chance Jake takes as he embarks on his journey to become an alchemist.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Meanwhile, Jake’s old colleagues find themselves part of a camp ruled by a power-hungry man named Richard and his loyal followers. Jacob (no, this is not Jake, just a similar name, and the author defends himself by claiming that he legitimately didn’t know Jake was a shortening of Jacob when he began writing the novel, and by the time he noticed it was too late), Jake’s former boss tries to do his best, but repeatedly finds himself used and led behind the light as he does what he truly thinks is for the best.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Another young man named William also enters the picture here, a stereotypical psycho that the author really overdid it with, and even if he hoped for the guy to be hateable, he maybe took it a bit too far. Anyway, William does psycho stuff at the behest of an unseen god that aims to control the Tutorial from behind the scenes and has some unknown goals you may or may not learn more about in this book.</p>
      <p class="subsq">In an attempt to fool their opponent, Richard tries to pin all the conflict of the Tutorial on Jake and ambush him. Assisted by William, who Jake gave a good smacking when they met, and Caroline, who fooled Jacob into helping them, they try to ambush Jake but fail, leaving Jake injured and forcing him into the inner part of the Tutorial filled with even stronger beasts.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Jake decides to just try and forget his own colleagues and old life as he goes on a hunt of his own, gaining all the levels he can before finally finding a regular dungeon in the Tutorial’s inner zone. Eager to find more powerful foes, Jake enters, and upon finally clearing the dungeon by killing the final boss – a Beast Lord – he gets a quest to kill three more Beast Lords before finally being able to face the big boss of the Tutorial: the King of the Forest.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Outside of the inner zone, things have turned to shit, and a final confrontation between the two factions takes place, resulting in everyone dead but William, who is left injured on the battlefield, and the non-combatants. They are led by Jacob, who has recently become an Augur of Hope and joined the Holy Church after refusing to kill William, who was the cause of so much grief. An incredibly non-controversial decision no one ever took issue with.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Besides that, we had Casper, Jake’s old co-worker, and friend, becoming undead and teleporting out of the Tutorial, lots of hunting and levels, overly long explanations, and drawn-out sections of picking a skill even though the answer was obvious from the start, and much, much more.</p>
      <p class="subsq">Will Jake be able to defeat the King of the Forest and return to Earth? Will he die, and the novel abruptly ends in an incredibly unsatisfying way, making you take to the internet and righteous rage?</p>
      <p class="subsq">Find out in this episo- book of The Primal Hunter!</p>
