The sharp hand of justice. The Black Talon.</span> Gifted a soul-forged bond with his dragon, Umbris, Kullen is tasked with hunting any and all who oppose the Empire. But when the secretive Crimson Fang murders two noblemen before his very eyes, Kullen must discover the truth of who they are and what they want. What he uncovers is a web of lies and deceit spiraling into the depths of Dimvein. Natisse, a high-ranking member of the rebellion known as the Crimson Fang, has no greater goal than to rid Dimvein of power-hungry nobles. Haunted by her past, fire, flames, and the death of her parents, she sets out to destroy the dragons and those who wield them as unstoppable weapons of destruction. Until she, too, finds herself buried beneath the weight of the revelations her investigations reveal... The Empire is under siege from within, and one man, dressed in black like the night, stands at the epicenter of it all.</p></div>

But when they use a strange new die, they are instantly transported to a fantasy world where all gaming ideas can come true. Together, the party must join forces to deal with the vile Necrolord whose plans will not only threaten this world, but Earth as well. Should be easy for a team of lifelong gamers. However, when gaming and real life collide, there are situations which can't be anticipated. Will Samo use science to solve all her problems? Will Wyatt always resort to violence? Will Bourbon discover lost treasure? Will Falcon restore his kingdom. <span id="page_667"/>Will Melf, the bard, find his pants?</p></div>

Sent back in time to change humanity's fate.</span> After experiencing a future where all of humanity’s planets and colonies had been purged, Eric refused to fall. And so, the Entity chose him to be humanity's last hope—to be Reborn... The Reborn are galactic boogiemen. Myths and legends used to terrify children and curb the aggression of advanced alien civilizations. They are usually granted boons and abilities able to grow powerful enough to destroy star systems, making them the number one target of every alien race out there. But in Eric’s case, the Entity had screwed humans. Instead of being given powers that could make him like a god, they are barely classed as special. With only his memories and a couple of minor boons, Eric needs to survive evil elements within humanity, the circling alien races that would do anything to eliminate him, and change history sufficiently so that when the Traclaon Empire declares war, his species can fight back. In his first life, Eric was inconsequential. In this life, he will be anything but….</p></div>
