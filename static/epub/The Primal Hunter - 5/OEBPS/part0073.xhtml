<p class="class_s7A-4"><span class="class_s7A-0">J</span>ake stood on the edge of the pond at this cabin, staring out onto the water. His body was fully healed, but the same couldn’t be said about his equipment, as it was still in tatters, and he stood with only a single boot on his feet.</p>
<p class="class_s7C-2">He heard sounds behind him as Miranda entered the valley. He was too lost in thought to even react.</p>
<p class="class_s7C-2">"I came here as soon as possible. What happened towards the end? I heard some from Neil, but—"</p>
<p class="class_s7C-2">She stopped when she spotted something lying to his side. Jake followed her gaze to the two pieces of wood lying next to him, only a loose string connecting them—severed by a clean cut.</p>
<p class="class_s7C-2">Jake raised his hand and touched his neck, where a small scar was still visible. The feeling of the blade digging into it was also still there.</p>
<p class="class_s7C-2">"… I think I lost?"</p>
<div class="class_s9V-1"><div class="class_s9R"><img src="image_rsrc68H.jpg" alt="" class="class_s9N"/></div></div>
<p class="class_s9X-2">The courtyard of the Noboru clan’s Patriarch was silent as Reika rushed towards it hurriedly, ignoring all the clamoring from the <span id="page_625"/>other clan members on the way. Given her worry, she didn’t even knock before entering it swiftly.</p>
<p class="class_s7C-2">Inside, she saw a single chair in front of a few paintings. The Patriarch was sitting there, his back turned. He didn’t acknowledge her right away as she took in his weak form. His skin was bare, and he looked weaker than usual.</p>
<p class="class_s7C-2">"Great-grandfather?" she asked, more worried than before, only calmed down a little when he finally spoke.</p>
<p class="class_s7C-2">"Could you help me stand?" he said weakly, turning his head and smiling.</p>
<p class="class_s7C-2">Reika was confused as she hurried over to him, lending him her arm to stand. Failing to hold back her curiosity, she asked, "What happened?"</p>
<p class="class_s7C-2">Her great-grandfather smiled and touched a small scar on the side of his skull. "I wonder?"</p>
<p class="class_s7C-2">She was only more confused, especially as she felt him lean on her, his steps unsteady. She frowned and asked, "Are… are you okay?"</p>
<p class="class_s7C-2">He gave her a comforting smile as he looked up at the sky, a few sparse clouds hanging above. "After the growth of spring and the life of summer, fall follows where everything wanes before we settle into a restful winter. So to ask if I am okay… Right now, no, but eventually, I will be. With time."</p>
<p class="class_s7C-2">"How long?" Reika asked, having understood somewhat.</p>
<p class="class_s7C-2">The Patriarch shook his head. "You cannot hurry a season to pass like that. Once winter comes, I will return to normal and have to rebuild myself to prepare for spring once more."</p>
<p class="class_s7C-2">"Rebuild?" she followed up.</p>
<p class="class_s7C-2">He chuckled a bit, shaking his head again. "According to my level, I am only at 112, with a 135 in parenthesis… I believe I will have to regain those levels before I can call upon another Springtime Advent."</p>
<p class="class_s7C-2">"That is… What did you do?" Reika asked, distraught. She knew he had powered up beyond what should be possible, but she hadn’t expected the cost to be that high<span id="page_626"/>.</p>
<p class="class_s7C-2">"That is something I am still uncertain of, even now… but the system calls it a transcendence."</p>
<p class="class_s7C-2">He didn’t elaborate, but simply asked for her to help him into his bedchamber, as he felt tired. For a D-grade, to truly feel tired was something Reika had very rarely seen, and it made her worried. She felt he was barely stronger than a regular old man before the system. Nevertheless, she helped him get into the bed, not even bothering to remove any of his tattered clothes.</p>
<p class="class_s7C-2">The moment he lay down, he thanked her quietly, closed his eyes, and went to sleep. Reika stayed at his side till he woke up again, which wouldn’t occur until more than twenty hours later.</p>
<div class="class_s9V-1"><div class="class_s9R"><img src="image_rsrc68H.jpg" alt="" class="class_s9N"/></div></div>
<p class="class_s9X-2">Jake had taken a seat on one of his porch chairs, having asked Miranda to leave, as he needed a few moments to himself to gather his thoughts. He had even told Villy to wait, his godly pal understanding and waiting for him to reach out and talk. He sounded curious to know what had happened, but countless years of being alive had clearly honed his patience.</p>
<p class="class_s7C-2">He looked at the broken bow he had placed on the table beside him, the wood cleanly cut through. He remembered the final moment where he’d released the string. The sword had come up a fraction of a moment faster than he had expected. The final thing he remembered was seeing his arrow hit the side of the Sword Saint’s head as, simultaneously, the swordman’s blade dug into his own neck.</p>
<p class="class_sKJ-1">I lost…</p>
<p class="class_s7C-2">The thought dominated his mind as he sat there. It wasn’t his first time losing a fight. He had lost to the damn blue mushroom more than once, technically lost to a bunch of random cloud elementals when he couldn’t beat them alone, and some could also argue he’d lost to the King of the Forest.</p>
<p class="class_s7C-2">But this was different. Jake hadn’t lost to some powerful being tens of levels or a grade above him. He hadn’t lost to <span id="page_627"/>someone it was expected of him to lose to. Instead, he had lost to another human who had been in the system as long as he had.</p>
<p class="class_s7C-2">Okay, maybe one could argue it was a tie because even if Jake had died, so would the Sword Saint. The old man had still had poison flowing through his body at the end, and with his power-up ending, he would for sure have died—likely even without factoring in the poison. So both of them had been saved by the system event ending. There were no two ways about it.</p>
<p class="class_s7C-2">There was also no doubt in his mind that they had both lost their heads towards the end, with him nearly losing it in a literal sense. It had truly become a fight to the death as they’d both refused to give up. But he didn’t blame the Sword Saint at all, and he had a feeling the old man didn’t blame him either. Both had willingly put their lives on the line.</p>
<p class="class_s7C-2">He still wanted to figure out what the old man had done to get so powerful, but he would later ask Villy for some insight. For now, he chose to focus on something else entirely to make himself feel a little better:</p>
<p class="class_s7C-2">Rewards.</p>
<p class="class_s7C-2">Jake had seen the system messages right as he returned, and now finally opened them.</p>
<p class="class_s8U-0">The Treasure Hunt has ended!</p>
<p class="class_sFR-2">With the Treasure Hunt ending, the winners become clear as the truly talented Treasure Hunters are separated from the others. Due to your performance against the Cursed Monarch and subsequent triggering and victory over the Monarch of Blood, coupled with all treasures collected, you have proven yourself a Premier Treasure Hunter. Know that you stand at the apex, achieving the highest reward possible.</p>
<p class="class_s8U-0">You have earned the title: [Premier Treasure Hunter<span id="page_628"/>]</p>
<p class="class_s8W-0">Note: All treasures within the Hunter Insignia must be retrieved within the next 24 hours before the Insignia disappears. Any items not received will be dumped in your immediate surroundings.</p>
<p class="class_s7C-2">It was short and sweet, in many ways. It didn’t contain much superfluous information and more or less just told him that he was a good boy who had found a lot of treasures and beaten the Monarch of Blood. Maybe he had even gotten first place in the entire Treasure Hunt? It was possible, and it did help him feel better to know that he had at least maybe won that one over the Sword Saint, as it seemed to put a lot of emphasis on the Monarch of Blood fight.</p>
<p class="class_s7C-2">Also, he did find it a bit funny how it mentioned just dumping everything if he didn’t take it out. It would be funny to see someone walk in the street a day from now just to see the entire area filled with stuff.</p>
<p class="class_s7C-2">Shaking his head, trying to cheer himself up with happy thoughts, he moved on. Next up, he naturally checked out the title, going in with pretty low expectations but finding himself pleasantly surprised.</p>
<p class="class_s3PA"><span class="class_s67N">[Premier Treasure Hunter] – You are at the apex of Treasure Hunters</span>—<span class="class_s67N">not only a true talent when it comes to retrieving what was once lost, but also in defeating any who dare stand between you and your rightful bounty. +10% Perception, + 10% Agility, +5% Wisdom.</span></p>
<p class="class_s7C-2"><span class="class_s67M">That is a lot more than expected</span>, Jake thought. He had expected it to be more like the title from a dungeon or something like that, not a percentage amplifier. He also noted that it was in his three highest stats, making him assume that was no coincidence. That did help him feel a bit more vindicated with drinking a lot of Agility-enhancing elixirs, as he now had the percentage amplifier for <span id="page_629"/>that increase.</p>
<p class="class_s7C-2">He quickly got to the thing the note mentioned by summoning items from his Hunter Insignia, which was still functional. Out of curiosity, he tried to redeposit something but found he couldn’t. <span class="class_s67M">So, only taking things out</span>.</p>
<p class="class_s7C-2">Jake spent the next few minutes just taking all of the stuff out of the Insignia and placing it in his storage necklace. At least, he tried to, until he got to a few massive gates of black metal that just fell to the ground, making the earth shake with his failure to deposit those into his necklace.</p>
<p class="class_s7C-2">Staring at them a bit, he asked himself why he was so adamant about getting those again, but was quick to move on with cleaning up the Insignia. To his surprise, he even found his own scimitar in there, the system having been nice enough to give it back after the collapsing world of Yalsten swallowed it up.</p>
<p class="class_s7C-2">When all of that was done, he sat down once more, looking at the crater in the ground formed by the metal gates with a small snicker. He got an idea of what to do with them, but that could wait for later.</p>
<p class="class_s7C-2">Jake stretched on the chair and opened his status menu to get a feel for his progress over the last ten days or so.</p>

<p class="class_s7C-2">Growth across the board, especially in Perception—Jake had continued his path of putting all Free Points in it—but also good growth in Agility and even Toughness, primarily due to his Scales of the Malefic Viper upgrading to legendary during the Hunt.</p>
<p class="class_s7C-2">Speaking of skill upgrades, he had also gotten a few of those. Naturally, there was Scales, but also Alchemical Flames in the early day of the event, and during the last fight and the lead-up to it, he’d gotten three whole rarity upgrades to his Limit Break, making it into Arcane Awakening.</p>
<p class="class_s7C-2">He had undoubtedly gained a lot from the Treasure Hunt… but<span id="page_632"/>…</p>
<p class="class_s7C-2">Jake sighed and stared up into the sky. He heard another noise behind him as someone entered the valley. He had told Miranda to leave him be for now, but there was someone who really sucked at heeding orders.</p>
<p class="class_s7C-2">Sylphie flew over and landed on the table next to him. She stared at the broken bow and back to him as she screeched. Jake shook his head and nuzzled her, and she happily wriggled her head as he scratched her.</p>
<p class="class_s7C-2">Smiling, he lifted her up. She didn’t resist while he sat with her like she was a cat, just petting her and letting her enjoy every moment.</p>
<p class="class_s7C-2">After a while, Jake finally spoke. "I’ll win next time. And not in a way that will leave anything up to ambiguity."</p>
<p class="class_s7C-2">To which Sylphie gave an encouraging screech in approval, clearly not having a single trace of doubt in her mind.</p>
<p class="class_s7C-2">--</p>
<p class="class_s7C-2">As the Treasure Hunt ended, humanity and the Risen were all returned to Earth once more, swiftly finding out that even if they had been gone for nearly ten days, not even ten hours had passed outside of the Hunt.</p>
<p class="class_s7C-2">A few settlements had experienced minor attacks by beasts during this time, but most had made preparations to be gone longer, meaning none of the major settlements had any real issues. There were even signs that beasts had been less inclined to attack during the nearly half a day of absence of nearly all D-grade humans and Risen. This led to theories that perhaps they had their own event to participate in or opportunities, but nothing was provable.</p>
<p class="class_s7C-2">An hour or so after everyone had returned, another message appeared before all of the recently returned people, reminding them and informing them of what was next to come.</p>
<p class="class_s8U-0">System Announcement<span id="page_633"/>.</p>
<p class="class_s8W-0">With the end of the Treasure Hunt, the Auction will begin a week from now. Further information will follow a day before the Auction begins. Note that any participant of the Treasure Hunt can also attend the Auction.</p>
<p class="class_s7C-2">Many instantly began scrambling to prepare, while others took it more calmly. One such place was Haven, where nothing much happened for the first many hours after the Treasure Hunt ended. Miranda planned a meeting where they went over things; the city owner was suspiciously absent, yet none dared to go and check his valley without permission.</p>
<p class="class_s7C-2">With so many items gathered from Yalsten, everyone knew the coming period would be even busier. The entirety of Earth and all of the factions had just received a big influx of valuable items to help them in the future, with the upcoming Auction a huge opportunity to get rid of items they did not need themselves and receive items useful to them.</p>
<p class="class_s7C-2">But for now… for now, Jake just wanted to enjoy a few quiet hours with Sylphie and have a nice chat with Villy.</p>
