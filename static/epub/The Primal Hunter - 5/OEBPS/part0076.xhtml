<p class="class_s8Y-1"><span class="class_s8Y-0">M</span>iranda sorted through some lists Sultan had handed to her, as well as the formal contract he had written up mere moments after their return from the Treasure Hunt. She skimmed the contract over, already aware of what it was about, primarily looking for any word traps or phrasing she didn’t quite agree with.</p>
<p class="class_s7C-0">The contract was for him to act as a broker and sell items for Haven and Jake during the Auction a week later. The lists he had handed her included items he already possessed as well as people he had already made agreements with during the Hunt.</p>
<p class="class_s7C-0">Reading over the contract, it became clear the man was giving extremely favorable terms to them, seeking to only take a flat fee for high-value items and a small percentage on lower-priced goods, though he did emphasize his belief that nothing below epic-rarity would be sold at the Auction simply due to the volume of items gained from the Treasure Hunt.</p>
<p class="class_s7C-0">As for why Sultan was so interested in a deal—well, besides him being a businessman, that is—apparently, the Auction held some special implications and opportunities for merchants. If the World Congress was the arena of the politically minded and social classes, the Treasure Hunt the arena of the <span id="page_653"/>fighters, then the Auction was the event with the most opportunities for merchants.</p>
<p class="class_s7C-0">Sultan had received a quest that was more or less just about selling a lot of things, and he would be competing against others. Miranda did not believe they could beat out the larger factions simply due to the sheer quantity of items a city like Sanctdomo had to sell, but if Jake agreed to use Sultan for some of his higher-rarity items, she did believe Sultan could do well. Of course, she would have to get some more benefits from the man if they helped him succeed in a quest, but Miranda suspected he already knew that.</p>
<p class="class_s7C-0">"Lillian, is the report in from those who wish to sell through Haven?" Miranda asked the other woman in the room.</p>
<p class="class_s7C-0">While it was clear primarily items from the Treasure Hunt would be sold, some held valuables not from there. Even from some who did not participate in the Hunt at all, such as Phillip.</p>
<p class="class_s7C-0">"Most of them," Lillian answered as she brought over another stack of papers. "Neil and his party will sell through Haven, and a lot of the unaffiliated D-grades have also chosen to do so. Additionally, we have received thirteen requests to gain permanent residence from participants in the Hunt… which is all of those who returned but two."</p>
<p class="class_s7C-0">"Hm, thoughts?"</p>
<p class="class_s7C-0">"I do not believe there are many downsides to additional D-grades within the city, and if we wish to increase the average power level of Haven, it would be highly beneficial. The more we have, the more will also come by, as there will be more skilled crafters, more opportunities to find hunting parties, and more ways to sell and procure materials for everyone.”</p>
<p class="class_s7C-0">"You’re right," Miranda agreed. "Just have some basic tests done; maybe ask Silas to help."</p>
<p class="class_s7C-0">Miranda didn’t really have much more to do right away, as she had spent the last few days before the Hunt hectically planning for her own absence. They’d been told the Treasure Hunt would last ten days, and while many had suspected there would <span id="page_654"/>be some kind of time dilation going on due to the length of it and the constant threat of beasts, no one had known. Hence, she had been on the safe side.</p>
<p class="class_s7C-0">"Additionally, the sculp—"</p>
<p class="class_s7C-0">Lillian was interrupted by a knock on the door. Miranda was surprised—mainly because they hadn’t planned on anyone coming, but also because they’d heard it at all due to the enchantments meant to obscure sound.</p>
<p class="class_s7C-0">She sighed and waved her hand. The door opened to reveal Jake standing there—the only one she would suspect of, for some reason, sneaking into the main office of Haven. Well, that or an assassin, but it would be an odd strategy to knock first if it was an assassin.</p>
<p class="class_s7C-0">"Hey, Miranda, Lillian, anything interesting happen that I need to be aware of, or can I leave for a while?" he promptly asked.</p>
<p class="class_s7C-0">"Only some minor things related to the Auction," Miranda answered just as promptly, knowing not to mince words or ask unnecessary questions.</p>
<p class="class_s7C-0">She gave him a quick rundown, and Jake agreed without much hesitation to allow Sultan to sell some stuff for him. He didn’t specify what, but Miranda was sure she would find out in due time. There were also a few additional minor points, and she asked him his opinion on giving what was effectively citizenship to the D-grades who had applied.</p>
<p class="class_s7C-0">"Sure, why not?" he said with a shrug. "Just kick them out if they get annoying."</p>
<p class="class_s7C-0">"Duly noted," Miranda said with a smile. "Where are you heading off to anyway?"</p>
<p class="class_s7C-0">"Where the Court of Shadows is located. Sky-something. Ah, for that, I wanted to ask if you had any idea where it is, and also… would you happen to have a spare bow lying around?"</p>
<p class="class_s7C-0">"I think asking Neil about directions would be a good idea, as he has been working on the long-range teleportation circles, and as for a bow, maybe check in with Sultan, as he no doubt <span id="page_655"/>possesses some.” Inwardly, Miranda wondered why he would need a new bow.</p>
<p class="class_s7C-0">"Thanks. If there is nothing else, I’ll be off. I reckon we'll meet next in the Auction.”</p>
<p class="class_s7C-0">"Are you going to Skyggen to visit family?" Miranda asked, failing to hold her curiosity back.</p>
<p class="class_s7C-0">"Yeah, Caleb more or less ordered me to go, and it is about time to visit, so it makes no sense delaying," Jake confirmed, moving to leave.</p>
<p class="class_s7C-0">"Alright, have a nice trip. I still have the communication skill to contact you if anything comes up, so I will make sure to keep you updated on major events.”</p>
<p class="class_s7C-0">That got a nod of approval from him. They said their goodbyes as Jake left the room, his presence disappearing as soon as he left the office.</p>
<p class="class_s7C-0">"Didn’t you say he seemed down when you visited him just a few hours ago?" Lillian asked, confused.</p>
<p class="class_s7C-0">"He was, and he still is," Miranda said, shaking her head. It was just what her gut told her, and she felt like she had interacted enough with Jake to detect it. But he was better now than before for sure.</p>
<p class="class_s7C-0">"Either way, can you fetch Hank about the plans for expansion?" Miranda asked Lillian.</p>
<p class="class_s7C-0">"I believe he is busy with that young man who visited the temple with Lord Thayne a while back," Lillian answered. "They seem to be working on some kind of odd monument, and I am truthfully not certain what it is about… but according to the young man named Chris, it should be related to the Malefic One, Lord Thayne’s Patron god."</p>
<p class="class_s7C-0">Miranda nodded, already feeling a slight headache come on from whatever they were doing. She seriously doubted it could be anything that wouldn’t give her massive annoyances and the cause of many issues…</p>
<div class="class_s9V-0"><div class="class_s9R"><img src="image_rsrc68H.jpg" alt="" class="class_s9N"/></div></div>
<p id="page_656" class="class_s9X-0">Jake had quickly located Sultan, courtesy of the large, floating ship that also acted as his store. The merchant had quickly sold him a rare bow for level 120 and above, which was far worse than his old bow, but it was made solely with resilience in mind without any fancy effects. He did also have an epic bow for level 100 and above, but Jake preferred the rare one. It wasn’t the best, but it was all he had for now.</p>
<p class="class_s7C-0">He did ask him if he had any idea on fixing his broken bow, but Sultan said that anyone else but the original craftswoman would find it difficult, if not impossible after his own transmutation of it. He wasn’t even sure that the woman named Maria—who had made it—could fix the bow. Sultan instead recommended Jake dismantle it and reuse some of the materials, such as the two gems. It was a bit disappointing, but Jake took his words to heart and saved the broken pieces for later use. Now, he would just hope that a good bow would be sold at the Auction.</p>
<p class="class_s7C-0">Before he had gone to meet Miranda, Jake had also had a good chat with Sylphie. To his surprise, she had wanted to split up to go hunt and grow stronger. He felt a strong sense of inferiority from her, and she had seemed a bit sad at how little she had been able to help against the Monarch of Blood. There really wasn’t any need for her to feel like that, as she was already up there with the strongest on Earth, but she clearly still wasn’t satisfied.</p>
<p class="class_s7C-0">Needless to say, Jake wasn’t going to get in her way. Her parents were also not in Haven—likely out hunting too—so that probably only added to her sense of competitiveness. So, before Jake had even made it to Miranda’s office, she had taken off towards the forest like the zooming little hawk she was.</p>
<p class="class_s7C-0">He would lie if he said he hadn’t hoped to take her with him, but he wasn’t going to tell her what to do. Well, at least he could now look forward to hearing about her progress during the Auction. Ah, who was he kidding? They still had their connection that allowed some communication, and he had barely managed to exit Miranda’s office before she gave <span id="page_657"/>him the absolutely essential update on a funny-looking tree she had found and couldn’t break with her whooshy wind.</p>
<p class="class_s7C-0">Next up, he headed for the Fort where Neil was. The guy was still working on teleportation gates and had gone far enough to have one connect Haven and the Fort, which meant it only took a few seconds on a teleportation circle and some mana to travel the distance. Not that it would have taken him long without, but there was still like a hundred and fifty kilometers or something.</p>
<p class="class_s7C-0">Finding Neil in the Fort wasn’t hard either, as he was working on an even larger circle in his own house of sorts, which was more like a large warehouse or gymnasium. Jake had to respect his grit; the space mage had only been out of the Treasure Hunt for a few hours and was already straight back to work. In fact, he seemed even more filled with fervor than before when Jake saw him in his sphere.</p>
<p class="class_s7C-0">Jake knocked on the door, and a second person in the house opened it. Jake hadn’t seen a young lad before, and the guy seemed terrified, almost paralyzed, upon seeing Jake stand there. He stood there for a solid second before collecting himself, inviting Jake inside, and directing him towards Neil. Probably an assistant or something.</p>
<p class="class_s7C-0">Walking into his practice room, Jake saw a lot of half-made magic circles and small devices he didn’t recognize.</p>
<p class="class_s7C-0">Neil looked up as he detected Jake and promptly greeted him. "Ah, hey there!"</p>
<p class="class_s7C-0">"Hi," Jake said, giving a half-hearted wave while inspecting the room.</p>
<p class="class_s7C-0">"I have to know, who won?" Neil asked as he stopped doing whatever he was doing.</p>
<p class="class_s7C-0">"Not me," Jake answered. Even if the Sword Saint couldn’t be said to have won either, Jake had sure as hell not come out victorious.</p>
<p class="class_s7C-0">"Oh," Neil said, turning the situation far more awkward.</p>
<p class="class_s7C-0">"Anyway," Jake said, changing the topic. "Looking for some <span id="page_658"/>way to know the direction of Skyggen, as I am going there, and Miranda said you might have something."</p>
<p class="class_s7C-0">"Ah, sure!" Neil exclaimed, happily changing the topic. He waved his hand and took out a small metal disc that looked like a compass. "This is a copy of the Spatial Compass tied to the receiver circle I gave to Skyggen during the World Congress. Just infuse a bit of mana, and it will display an arrow." Neil then took out a small metal cube. "Also, if you are going, can you bring this with you? It is a small storage cube containing some research and improved coordinates and directions to syncing our teleportation circles. With hope, we can soon have a permanent teleportation circle connecting our two settlements."</p>
<p class="class_s7C-0">"Why not?" Jake agreed as he got both of the items. He instantly used the compass and saw it did indeed display an arrow, just like a regular compass.</p>
<p class="class_s7C-0">"One more thing," Neil said. "Want a boost on the way? I can send you a few thousand kilometers the right way without any problems. Ah, but it will be a bit random, and I can’t tell for sure where you will appear."</p>
<p class="class_s7C-0">Jake shrugged. "Sure thing. Would be nice getting there faster."</p>
<p class="class_s7C-0">"Great!" Neil said, smiling and muttering as he led Jake into another room with a circle already prepared. "I have been hoping to test the cost and challenges associated with teleporting someone substantially more powerful than myself…"</p>
<p class="class_s7C-0">Less than a minute later, Jake found himself standing on a magic circle as Neil made some small alterations to get the direction right. He placed a number of items to act as catalysts, and Jake made a mental note to compensate him. When everything was ready, Jake gave the go-ahead. Neil activated it, and Jake felt space around him distort. He could easily resist the effect if he wanted, but he allowed it to take effect as he disappeared.</p>
<p class="class_s7C-0">Jake felt himself travel through space for a second or two, his sphere acting up a bit, but nothing he couldn’t reign in. Finally, <span id="page_659"/>when he regained vision, he found himself standing on a large, flat stone surrounded by small mountains and hills.</p>
<p class="class_s7C-0">He barely had time to take in his surroundings before he detected movement. The rocks around him began moving on their own, and Jake turned his gaze and saw an almost humanoid-looking stack of stone assemble.</p>
<p class="class_sBB-0">[Summoned Stone Elemental – lvl 102]</p>
<p class="class_s7C-0">Jake raised his eyebrows as he looked a bit further and saw the head of a small figure atop a hill not far away. Soon, many more elementals appeared. Jake detected more than fifty figures surrounding the small vale he found himself in. Squinting, he finally got a good look at one of the small figures above as it peeked up to look at him.</p>
<p class="class_sBB-0">[Mountain Goat Rockshaper – lvl 114]</p>
<p class="class_sKJ-0">A fucking army of goats?</p>
<p class="class_s7C-0">Shaking his head, Jake just raised his hand and coiled arcane mana around it, and a dozen or so arcane bolts appeared. With a flick of his wrist, all of them fired out and hit the stone elementals, making them explode into dust instantly.</p>
<p class="class_s7C-0">Only half had been blown up, while the rest just crumbled, and when he looked up again, he saw all of the goats gone. Jumping, Jake took flight and stared at the many goats fleeing in all directions beneath him. Jake couldn’t help but chuckle at the cowardly beasts, and he naturally didn’t bother pursuing them.</p>
<p class="class_s7C-0">Killing such low-level beasts didn’t give him any experience, and he didn’t really blame the goats for attacking him either. He had kind of just appeared in the middle of what he assumed was their territory, giving off an aura he had been told several times wasn’t the most friendly. So them running away upon seeing he wasn’t someone they could deal with was just smart.</p>
<p class="class_s7C-0"><span class="class_s67M">Goodbye, little goats,</span> Jake thought as they all went into <span id="page_660"/>hiding, and he looked out over the vast landscape in front of him with rolling hills, mountains, vales, and valleys. When he closed his eyes, he even felt the auras of some beasts that would perhaps be worth challenging hidden within their own territories ahead of him.</p>
<p class="class_s7C-0">Jake found himself around three thousand kilometers away from Haven, which was quite impressive work from Neil. It was a nice head start for sure.</p>
<p class="class_s7C-0">Smiling to himself, Jake looked forward to finally meeting his family again. It had been a while since he had seen them, and he had been putting off visiting for far too long. He wondered what his mom and dad had been up to and how the system might have changed them, and he would be lying if he said he wasn’t nervous.</p>
<p class="class_s7C-0">Not putting off going any longer, he took out the compass and, without further ado, began his trip across the land. He was perhaps only missing a single important detail before taking off towards Skyggen:</p>
<p class="class_s7C-0">How far it was.</p>
